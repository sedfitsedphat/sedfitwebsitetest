<p>At this point, we can also <a href="sedfit_help_subtract_calculated_noise.htm">remove
the best-fit systematic noise</a>, by either pressing ctrl-N, or using the
display command, or using the button on the right upper corner of the scan plot.&nbsp; 
This will show us </p>

<p>In a final optimization step, we can increase the distribution range a little
more (s-min = 0.1 and s-max = 12), as there is still a peak at s-min and s-max,
and we can also increase the resolution to a value of 200:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori34.gif" width="443" height="299"></p>
<p>Click on the <a href="sedfit_help_run.htm">Run</a> command (note that this
will take a little longer now because of the higher resolution), and we get:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori49.jpg"></p>
<p>At first, this may seem like a worse analysis because the peaks almost
disappeared. However, the c(s) plot only appears this way because of the
rescaling to accommodate the very large peak at 0.1 S (which may not be a real
species but a result of correlation of small s-values with the baseline
parameters, see below).&nbsp; The fit has really
improved, as visible by the further decrease in the rmsd to 0.00449.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i><u><b><a name="usage of new rescale distribution function">NEW:</a></b></u></i><a name="usage of new rescale distribution function">
In order to visualize the distribution better, we can use the new function
'Rescale Distribution Plot' in the sedfit versions 8.3 and higher.&nbsp; (In
version 8.5 and higher, this is further simplified, see below).</a></font> </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori51.gif" width="689" height="494"> </p>
<p>A message box will appear that reminds how this function works: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori52.gif" width="405" height="96"> </p>
<p>The mouse arrow will change into a crosshair, and by pressing the right mouse
button, we can pull a rectangle while keeping the right mouse button pressed: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori53.gif" width="689" height="493"> </p>
<p>This rectangle will contain the s-Range of the new plot (the vertical
dimensions of our mouse rectangle are irrelevant, the plot will automatically
scaled): </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori54.gif" width="688" height="494"> </p>
<p>If you keep the control-key pressed while double-clicking with the right 
mouse-button at the peak locations, you will get output about the estimated 
molar mass values from the c(s) analysis:&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori24.gif" width="809" height="238"></p>
<p>Here, Mf means the molar mass taking into account the current best-fit 
frictional ratio f/f0. In parenthesis, the minimum molar mass value is given, 
which is based on the hydrodynamic law that f/f0 &gt; 1 for any macromolecule.</p>
<p>We can apply the same function again to zoom in on the species between 5 and
10 S:&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori55.gif" width="688" height="494"> </p>
<p>which results in a better view that visualizes clearly the third peak at
~8.5S.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori56.gif" width="688" height="495"> </p>
<p>We can go back by using the Fullscale Distribution Plot command: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori57.gif" width="689" height="495"> </p>
<p>which leads back to the original view of the distribution. </p>
<p><font color="#FF00FF"><i><b>New: Please note that in version 8.5 and later,
we can now directly draw a rectangle in the area of the distribution plot,
without invoking the menu function.&nbsp; The distribution plot can be switched
back to fullscale with a right mouse button click into the distribution
plot.&nbsp;</b></i></font> </p>
<p>As a more flexible alternative, I recommend to copy the
distribution data into the clipboard by using the following <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Data Tables">copy
command</a>: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori36.gif" width="620" height="475"></p>
<p>Then, we can open a spreadsheet program for plotting, such as Origin, and
paste the distribution data into a worksheet.&nbsp; (Alternatively, the
distribution data can be <a href="sedfit_help_datautilities.htm#Save Calculated Distribution">saved</a>
to the hard disk as an ASCII file, and imported into the plot program.)&nbsp;
There, we can conveniently rescale the distribution axis to inspect the final
c(s) result, for example </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori37.gif" width="415" height="317"></p>
<p>Please note the axis break at 1.0.&nbsp; Here, we can also use numerical
integration functions to get the partial loading concentrations of the different
peaks (area under the peaks, see below). </p>
<p>What does the apparent peak at 12 S mean?&nbsp; Since 12 S was our maximum
value allowed for the distribution, it does <b>not </b>mean that the
distribution includes species at 12 S.&nbsp; In fact it mostly indicates that
there are species larger than the maximum s-value.&nbsp; This can be verified by
increasing s-max to 15, which leads to the following distribution:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori39.gif" width="409" height="317"></p>
<p>Here, the peak at 12 S has disappeared, and a very small abundance of species
with &gt; 15S is apparent.&nbsp; The rmsd value of this fit has slightly
improved to a value of 0.004578. </p>
<p>While the peak at the value of s-min can in general indicate the
presence of material with smaller s-value, it is possible that it is simply a
result of the correlation between the baseline and systematic noise parameters
and species with 0.1 S, in which case it may be ignored.&nbsp; This situation would be slightly improved if later scans
could be included into the data analysis. </p>
<p>Note in version 11.0 or higher, this correlation is by default suppressed 
using Bayesian expectation for the absence of a peak at s-min. The fact that it 
still appears partially indicates that there may be a small buffer mismatch in 
the sample and reference sector that leads to a signal contribution from buffer 
salts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At this stage, using our knowledge of BSA, we can interpret the c(s)
curve.&nbsp; First, we can integrate the areas under the peaks, either in the
plotting program (such as Origin), or within sedfit: </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i><b><a href="sedfit_help_size_distribution_options.htm#Integrate Distribution" name="usage of new integration tool for distributions">NEW:&nbsp;
Also, using the new integration
tool, we can calculate the loading concentration and weight-average s-value
under each of the peaks:</a></b></i></font></p>
<p>With the menu function &quot;integrate distribution&quot; located in the
Options-&gt; Size-Distribution Options menu (or using the keyboard shortcut
ctrl-i [version 8.5 and later])</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori58.gif" width="266" height="102"> </p>
<p>a message box will appear that reminds that this function works exactly as
the zooming tool for the distribution plot: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori52.gif" width="405" height="96"> </p>
<p>The mouse arrow will change into a crosshair, and by pressing the right mouse
button, we can pull a rectangle while keeping the right mouse button
pressed.&nbsp; Again, the y-value of the rectangle is irrelevant.&nbsp; For
example, if we want to analyze the ~6.7S peak, we can specify the following
range </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori59.gif" width="690" height="495"> </p>
<p>Releasing the right mouse button after spanning the rectangle will
immediately display the information </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori60.gif" width="304" height="120"> </p>
<p>on the integration range, the loading concentration (0.25 fringes) of the
material under the specified peak and it's fraction of the total loading
concentration (3.8%), as well as the weight-average s-value of the material,
which is 6.68S. It should be noted, however, that the fraction of the total
material (the 3.8%) in our example does include the artificial peak at 0.1 S. In
order to get the true fraction of the <i>sedimenting </i>material, we need to
integrate over that range (e.g. from 1 - 15S, including all true peaks), which
gives a total loading concentration of 2.17 fringes. Therefore, the loading
concentration of 0.25 fringes from the 6.68S species corresponds to 11.5% of the
total loading concentration.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This analysis shows that, in addition to the main
peak from the BSA monomer, there is present a fraction (~1%) of small
species (probably from proteolytic degradation), as well as 11-12% of dimeric
BSA, 2-3% of BSA trimer, and probably a total of 0.8% of larger oligomers.&nbsp;
The statistical accuracy of the s-values and the abundance of all species could
be studied using the <a href="sedfit_help_monte_carlo_simulations.htm">Monte-Carlo
statistics</a> function. </p>
