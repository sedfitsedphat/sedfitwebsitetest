<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An introduction to the theory and practice of the analysis method by van
Holde and Weischet (<a href="#ref1">ref 1</a>) can be found <a href="vhw_analysis.htm">here</a>.&nbsp;
Reading of this website is suggested before use of the method.&nbsp;&nbsp;As
described in this <a href="vhw_analysis.htm">introduction</a>, it is an elegant
extrapolation method for boundary diagnostics.&nbsp; For quantitative analysis
of the sedimentation data, these method are surpassed in many respects by direct boundary models, especially by Lamm equation
solutions and <a href="sedfit_help_cs.htm">size-distributions c(s)</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A) <b><font COLOR="#0000ff"><a name="Model | van Holde-Weischet">Model | van Holde-Weischet</a></p>
</font></b>
<p>Very important for the use of the van Holde-Weischet method is the selection
of appropriate data subsets.&nbsp; As explained in the <a href="vhw_analysis.htm">tutorial</a>,
we need for each scan plateaus to be established, and we need the solvent
plateau near the meniscus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>This model is only good for absorbance data.</b></p>
<p><b>The convention in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>  is
that the plateau must be established for all scans within the 0.05 cm left to
the outer fitting limit (take the right green line and go back 0.05 cm -- this
should all be flat in all scans).&nbsp; The solvent plateau must be established
within the 0.05 cm right to the inner fitting limit of the last scan (look at
the left green line, go 0.05 cm to larger radii -- this should be flat for the
last scan).&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>The following data set fulfills this condition:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit54.gif" width="695" height="248"></p>
<p>When switching on the van Holde-Weischet model, a message box appears:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit55.gif" width="293" height="98"></p>
<p>The analysis can be performed for sedimentation data and for flotation
data.&nbsp; Usually, you can simply press Enter key here, unless when studying
floatation processes (the analysis is the same, but S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">EDFIT</span>
 must be told which one to use).&nbsp; In case of flotation, all the information about required plateaus is understood
in reverse, i.e. solution plateau near the meniscus for all scans and solvent
plateau near the bottom required for the last scan.</p>
<p>Next, the resolution N (i.e. the number of boundary divisions) must be
entered:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit56.gif" width="275" height="128"></p>
<p>By default, a value of 50 is recommended.&nbsp; This value is probably too
high in most cases, because it leads to very narrow increments of boundary
fractions.&nbsp; Dependent on the noise level of the data, there may be scans
that actually do not have any data points in one or more of the boundary
slices.&nbsp; If this is the case, the resolution will be automatically reduced,
until every scan has at least one data point in all fractions.&nbsp; This will
be a good value for the resolution, appropriate for the least-squares
determination of the radial position of the boundary fractions (see <a href="vhw_analysis.htm#Implementation in sedfit">the
implementation</a>).</p>
<p>Optionally, the well-known plot of the linear regression of the boundary
fractions will be shown, if yes (or press Enter key)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit57.gif" width="280" height="112"></p>
<p>Please note that the Parameters command does not apply here (there will be no
action when clicking on this menu), because there are no further parameters to
set.&nbsp; If the resolution parameter is to be changed, click with the mouse no
the <b><font COLOR="#0000ff">
Model | van Holde-Weischet </font></b>menu again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analysis will be executed by a <a href="sedfit_help_run.htm">Run</a>
command.&nbsp; If necessary, the number of boundary fractions will be reduced,
indicated by a text output:</p>
<p><font size="1"><b>dividing data in .. boundary fractions</b></font></p>
<p>and finally a message box:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit58.gif" width="280" height="98"></p>
<p>Press OK (or hit the Enter key), and two new graphs will appear instead of
the data and residuals plot: In the upper plot the apparent sedimentation
coefficient values for each boundary fraction versus inverse square root of
time, and in the lower plot the integral sedimentation coefficient distribution
G(s).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit51.gif" width="655" height="559"> </p>
<p> This s(app,i) plot and its
data can be copied using the <font FACE="Modern"><a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Graphics of Data and Residuals">copy
data plot</a></font> and the <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Data Tables">copy
data table</a>  command. (The copy data table command will give a table with 1/sqrt(t)
in the first column, followed by the best-fit values for each fraction (one
column is one fraction), followed by the experimental data for each fraction
[ignore the 0 at the 1/sqrt(t) of 0]).&nbsp; The G(s) distribution can be exported using the <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Data Tables">copy
distribution table</a> command.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that the scale in the G(s) plot is determined by the minimum and
maximum s-value occurring.&nbsp; The above example, the distribution is actually
very precise, as can be seen in a different axis scale (after exporting): </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit53.gif" width="512" height="423"> </p>
<p>Pressing the ESCAPE key will return to the usual display of the data and
residuals, and in the bottom part of the window, the
integral distribution G(s).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>It should be noted that here, S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> shows the best-fit position of each of the boundary
fractions directly in the raw data space, i.e. it calculates backwards from the
linear regression of s(app,i) vs 1/sqrt(time) to best-fit s(app) values, and
best-fit positions of the boundary fractions.&nbsp; This has the advantage that it allows to judge how well the data
are described by the van Holde-Weischet analysis. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit52.gif" width="656" height="559"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Troubleshooting:</b></p>
<p>If aberrant boundary fractions occur near the upper or lower end of the G(s)
distribution, I recommend recalculation of the analysis (click with the mouse no
the <b><font COLOR="#0000ff">
Model | van Holde-Weischet </font></b>menu again) with a significantly lower
resolution.&nbsp; (Aberrant fractions are usually a result of noise of the data
being larger than the concentration increment of the boundary division.&nbsp;
This averages out somewhat in the middle fractions, but noise from the plateaus
reaching into close-by boundary fractions gives a one-sided bias.)&nbsp;
Alternatively, if the resolution in the middle fractions shall not be
sacrificed, the distribution can be exported, and the aberrant extreme fractions
removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) <b><font COLOR="#0000ff"><a name="Model | extrapolate ls-g*(s) vs 1/sqrt(time)">Model | extrapolate
ls-g*(s) vs 1/sqrt(time)</a></p>
</font></b>
<p>In this variant, the position of the boundary fractions are not obtained
directly from the data.&nbsp; Instead, apparent s-values for boundary fractions are
obtained via equivalent area fractions of a series of ls-g*(s) curves, which
then are subjected to the same 1/sqrt(time) extrapolation.&nbsp; This allows working
in the presence of time-invariant and radial invariant noise. This model is
presented in more detail in the <a href="vhw_analysis.htm#The extrapolation of ls-g*(s)">tutorial</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Because of a constant total area under all the ls-g*(s) curves is needed,
similar constraints on the selection of data sets are imposed.&nbsp; To avoid
correlation of the baseline parameters with small s-value part of ls-g*(s), all
scans should be well clear of the meniscus.&nbsp; For a well-determined high
s-value limit of ls-g*(s), all scans should have a clearly established
plateau.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>It was found to work best when RI noise has been eliminated, for example
by manual <a href="sedfit_help_loading_options.htm#Eliminate Jitter">removal of
jitter</a>, and switching of RI noise in the parameter box.&nbsp; (This does not
apply to the TI noise, as TI noise can be taken into account.) This model can be applied equally to absorbance or
interference data.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>After selecting this model, a warning message appears,</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit59.gif" width="601" height="139"></p>
<p>as a reminder to the experimental character this model still has.&nbsp;
Although very good results have been obtained (<a href="#ref2">ref 2</a>),
overall very little experience with this approach is available.&nbsp; Further,
the extrapolation of ls-g*(s) has the same fundamental limitations in resolution
and sensitivity as the van Holde-Weischet method (see <a href="vhw_analysis.htm#The limitation for multiple species">the
limitations</a>), and is surpassed by the <a href="sedfit_help_cs.htm">c(s)
model</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After selecting the model, a message box</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit57.gif" width="280" height="112"></p>
<p>appears, similar to the van Holde-Weischet model.&nbsp; However, more input is required for
calculating ls-g*(s) which can be done by clicking on the <a href="sedfit_help_parameters.htm">Parameters</a>
menu:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit60.gif" width="358" height="303"></p>
<p>The top portion of the parameters box determines the ls-g*(s) parameters
(familiarity with the <a href="sedfit_help_ls-gs.htm">ls-g*(s) model</a> and the
<a href="lsgofs_distribution.htm">tutorial</a> is required).&nbsp; The fields
for <a href="sizedistributions.htm#parameter resolution">resolution</a> ('gofs
resolution'), <a href="sizedistributions.htm#s-min">s-min</a>, <a href="sizedistributions.htm#s-max">s-max</a>,
and <a href="sizedistributions.htm#confidence level (F-ratio)">confidence level</a>
are the same as in the other <a href="sizedistributions.htm">size-distribution
models</a>.&nbsp; A relatively low value for the gofs resolution (50) can be
sufficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because
we need to calculate ls-g*(s) curves at different times, the total number of scans is
subdivided in subsets, which are input in the field &quot;<b><a name="#scans for g*(s)">#scans for
g*(s)</a></b>&quot;. Some care has to be taken that this number is not too small,
resulting in instable ls-g*(s) curves, and not too large, resulting in poor time
resolution.&nbsp; I have good experience with a value of 10, but since I have not
systematically optimized this to the stage of developing a general
rule for good default values, some testing with different numbers may have to be
done.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Connected to this is the way in which the sets of scans are made,
either by combining the scans in sequences like [1,2,3] [4,5,6], etc. or like a moving box [1,2,3],
[2,3,4], [3,4,5], etc. Check ‘<a name="slide frame"><b>slide frame</b></a>’ box for this second
method, leave it unchecked for the first.&nbsp; Obviously, the sliding frame has the advantage of providing more ls-g*(s)
curves, but it also will take much more time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The middle part is concerned with the parameters for the extrapolation of the
area (corresponding to the boundary) fractions.&nbsp; The only parameter
required is the number of boundary divisions.&nbsp; I recommend here a not too
high number (&lt; 50), although due to the smoothness of the ls-g*(s)
distribution a larger number can be used than in the van Holde-Weischet
method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lower part, finally, consists of the usual baseline parameters and the
meniscus position.&nbsp; <b>Please note that it is possible to include
systematic noise in this model</b>, because each of the ls-g*(s) can be
calculated considering <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">systematic
time-invariant or radial-invariant noise</a>.</p>
<p>When the parameters have been specified, click on the <a href="sedfit_help_run.htm">Run</a>
command to start the analysis.&nbsp; This will cause the series of ls-g*(s)
distributions to be calculated.&nbsp; They are shown superimposed, and it can be
observed how the g*(s) distribution gets sharper with time (i.e. for the sets of
later scans).&nbsp; The result is shown in a similar representation as in the
van Holde-Weischet analysis:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit61.gif" width="722" height="556"></p>
<p>The extrapolation of the area fractions of ls-g*(s) on top, and the original
ls-g*(s) with the extrapolation G(s) in the lower graphics.&nbsp; Again, they
can be copied using the <font FACE="Modern"><a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Graphics of Data and Residuals">copy
data plot</a></font> and the <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Data Tables">copy
data table</a> command. The G(s) distribution and the ls-g*(s) distributions can
be exported using the <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Data Tables">copy
distribution table</a> command.&nbsp; When using this <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Data Tables">copy
distribution table</a> command, a message box appears&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit62.gif" width="122" height="99"></p>
<p>prompting for a selection if either the complete set of ls-g*(s) or the G(s)
distribution should be placed into the clipboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pressing the ESCAPE key will return to the usual display of the data and
residuals, and in the bottom part of the window, the
integral distribution G(s) together with the ls-g*(s) distributions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit63.gif" width="722" height="557"></p>
<p>Similar to the van Holde-Weischet analysis, from the linear regression of the
apparent sedimentation coefficients s(app,i) of the boundary/area fractions, we
can get the best-fit s(app,i) values, and as a consequence, the best-fit radial
positions of the boundary fractions.&nbsp; These best-fit boundary fractions can
be composed into an explicit boundary model, which allows calculating the
overall best-fit <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">systematic noise</a>
contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some experimenting with optimal parameters may be required, as the G(s)
distribution can be sensitive to outlier g*(s) distributions.&nbsp; It seems
advantageous if the systematic noise can be reduced to either RI noise or TI
noise, as I have observed that both together can lead to poor extrapolation in
the lower boundary fractions.</p>
