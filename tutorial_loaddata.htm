<p><u><b><a name="Loading the data and preparing the analysis">Loading the data and preparing the analysis</a></b></u></p>
<p>Load the complete data set into S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>.&nbsp; A detailed description on how
to load data can be found <a href="sedfit_help_loadnewdata.htm">here</a>.&nbsp;
Initially, the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> 
 window will look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori1.gif" width="656" height="472"></p>
<p>with the data plot on top, and the residuals plot below initially showing the
same data.</p>
<p><font color="#800080">NEW in version 11.0 and higher: The default color 
scheme is scaled such that the first scans are black/blue and the last scans are 
deep red.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#800080" size="2">All colors should be visible after loading the 
scans.&nbsp; (When loading other data sets where some of the scans are very late 
in the run such that virtually only superimposing baselines are scanned in the 
final scans, the red colors will all superimpose and be hardly visible.)<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori29.jpg"></p>
<p>Please note that the sedimentation was not recorded to completion; for this
sample under the conditions of this run, approximately 200 scans instead of only
130 would be
required for an optimal analysis.&nbsp; In general, it is highly recommended to
include a data set as large as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a next step, <a name="select the bottom, meniscus, and the outer and inner fitting limits">select
the bottom, meniscus, and the outer and inner fitting limits</a>.&nbsp; How to
do this is described in very detail in the help section for the menu on <a href="sedfit_help_loadnewdata.htm">how
to load new files</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this particular sample, I would set the limits as shown here:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori2.gif" width="655" height="474"></p>
<p>(After entering the fitting limits, the residuals plot switches to show all
the data between the fitting limits.)</p>
<p>By <a href="sedfit_help_plot_range.htm#Setting the Display Range with the Right Mouse Button">spanning
a rectangle with the right mouse button</a>, we can zoom into the meniscus
region, and take a closer look at the position of the meniscus:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori4.gif" width="627" height="211"></p>
<p>In my experience, the red line is the <a name="best estimate for the meniscus">best
estimate for the meniscus</a> of the sample column.&nbsp; Just 0.01 cm to the
left of the red line, the scans show diagonal lines pointing down from left to
right -- this is a sign that the sample solution column is a little bit shorter
than the reference column (if the reference column was shorter, the lines would
be diagonally increasing (instead of decreasing), and the proper meniscus position would be on the left
of the diagonal section). Right mouse double-click goes back to the previous
view.</p>
<p>For the bottom region, please note that the outer fitting limit was set at approximately 7.15 cm, in
order to exclude the <a name="back diffusion">back-diffusion</a> from the
bottom.&nbsp; This is not necessary, in principle, and should not be done when
dealing with small molecules that show a significantly larger
back-diffusion.&nbsp; In this case, the back-diffusion, does contain significant
information and should not be ignored.&nbsp; Because the Lamm equation describes
back-diffusion, there is no problem modeling it as long as the gradient is not
too steep and optical detection is reliable.&nbsp; However, modeling
back-diffusion does give the bottom position a great importance for the
model.&nbsp; Because we rarely know the bottom position with good precision, it
should be treated as a floating parameter when modeling back-diffusion.&nbsp; In
cases like shown here for the BSA, however, we can simply exclude this range
from the analysis, which has the advantage that we do not need to worry much
about the exact bottom position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, it is very convenient to use the keyboard short-cut Ctrl-D,
which magnifies the <a href="sedfit_help_plot_range.htm#Setting the Display Range">data
range</a> .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori3.gif" width="657" height="473"></p>
<p>So far, in contrast to other analysis software, no correction for any of the
integral fringe shifts, the jitter or the time-invariant noise has been
made.&nbsp; In fact, this will be part of the model, as explained in the <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">introduction
to the systematic noise analysis</a>.&nbsp; After the analysis, we can subtract
the best-fit systematic noise contributions, and focus on the sedimentation
signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
