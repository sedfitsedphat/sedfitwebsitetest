<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366">Multi-signal c<sub>k</sub>(s) analysis for multi-component mixtures<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>This model is for multi-component mixtures, and designed to take advantage of 
different extinction coefficient of the sedimenting protein components, in order 
to determine c(s) sedimentation coefficient distributions for each component in 
solution.&nbsp; This can enable to determine the <font color="#FF0000"><b>
composition of protein complexes</b></font>, which can be highly useful in order 
to determine the association scheme and resolve multiple co-existing complexes.</p>

<p>In the simplest form, multiple signals are globally fitted as component 
sedimentation coefficient distributions</p>

<p>For stable mixtures on the time-scale of sedimentation, the interpretation is 
straight-forward, as the c<sub>k</sub>(s) distributions are simply <b>molar<i>
</i>sedimentation coefficient distributions of each component</b>.&nbsp; This 
can be extended by applying constraints for minimal stoichiometries of larger 
species.&nbsp; For rapidly reversible interactions the complexes must be 
stabilized via mass action law, i.e. sufficiently high saturation of complexes 
in the reaction boundary must be maintained (e.g. loading concentrations &gt; 5fold 
Kd).&nbsp; </p>

<p><b><u><a name="STEP 1: Planning">STEP 1: Planning of the Experiment</a></u></b></p>

<p>This analysis requires data acquisition at multiple signals.&nbsp; At least 
as many signals should be used as protein components are present.&nbsp; 
(Inclusion of a larger number of signals than of protein components is possible, 
and may have advantages.)&nbsp; Examples for possible configurations are:</p>

<p>* interference optical data + a single absorbance signal at either 230, 250, 
or 280 nm or VIS (for proteins), or 260 nm (nucleic acids)</p>

<p>* absorbance 280 nm + absorbance 250 nm</p>

<p>* absorbance 280 nm + absorbance 230 nm</p>

<p>* interference optical data + absorbance 280 nm + absorbance 250 nm</p>

<p>I found problematic the combination of absorbance 280, 250, and 230 due to 
the limited dynamic range of concentrations that can be observed, and also the 
use of far UV &lt; 250 nm other than 230 nm (exploiting the UV lamp emission peak 
to improve the monochromaticity of the light).</p>

<p>Time required to scan multiple absorbance wavelengths is not a problem, and 
neither is the wavelength accuracy of the XLA/I as long as the wavelengths 
chosen are on a maximum or minimum of the extinction profile.&nbsp; Usually it 
is not necessary to drop the rotor speed in order to get a larger numbers of 
scans. </p>

<p>Obviously, the choice of the detection is dictated by the extinction 
coefficients of the components to be studied, which must be sufficiently 
different.&nbsp; Many proteins differ significantly in the signal increments of 
IF/UV280/UV250 due to different numbers of tryptophan and tyrosine residues, 
which can be used to distinguish them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>For the equivalent of the molar extinction coefficient for IF detection, use 
a value of of 3.3Mw/1.2, if Mw is the molar mass of the protein, and 1.2 cm is 
the pathlength of the cell.&nbsp; This is true, only, if there's no non-amino 
acid component in the protein:&nbsp; for example, glycosylation would change the 
IF signal increment of the protein.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For each protein component, the molar signal increment at one signal must be 
known.&nbsp; This can be either the IF signal increment, or (if the protein is 
modified) an extinction coefficient at a wavelength used in the data 
acquisition.</p>

<p>For discrimination of the protein components, the signal increments must be 
different at characteristic wavelengths.&nbsp; A simple test for unmodified 
proteins can be to calculate the weight-based extinction coefficient with 
SEDNTERP (OD/mg/ml), which should be &gt;&gt; 10% different for successful 
discrimination with IF/ABS280 signal combination.&nbsp; Alternatively, one can 
use SEDNTERP to plot the theoretical extinction spectrum, and estimate the ratio 
of extinction at 280 versus 250 nm.&nbsp; Again, two proteins can be 
distinguished by ABS280/ABS250 dual-wavelength detection if they differ in their 
extinction ratio. </p>

<p><b>Run each protein separately, in the same run with the the mixtures,&nbsp; 
in order to determine the extinction coefficients experimentally in the 
ultracentrifuge.&nbsp; See
<a href="#STEP 3: Analysis of Extinction Coefficients">Step 3</a>.</b></p>

<p><b><u><a name="STEP 2: Loading Data Sets">STEP 2: Loading Data Sets</a></u></b></p>

<p>Load the data for each wavelength/signal separately as a new SV experiment.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When using multiple absorbance wavelength, it can be inconvenient to select 
the files of a certain wavelength only, because they are named by the XLA/I 
operating software in strict sequence of data acquisition, irrespective of 
wavelength.&nbsp; In this case, load all absorbance data and apply the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span> 
tool
<a target="_blank" href="../sedfit_help_loading_options.htm#Save Raw Data Set">
Save Raw Data Set</a> (a function in the Loading Options) to write a copy of the 
absorbance files with altered filenames to the hard disk.&nbsp; The filenames 
will have information on the data acquisition wavelength (e.g. 
'50k280_001.ra2'), and this facilitates the selection of the velocity scans from 
each signal.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In my experience, a shift of wavelength by 1 or 2 nm is not detrimental to 
the data, and I would recommend loading all scans within a narrow range of 
wavelengths.&nbsp; As usual, load files from the beginning to the end of 
sedimentation, but avoid including a large number of scans that only show a 
completely depleted cell (this would slow down the calculations a lot).</p>

<p>You do <b>not </b>need to enter the extinction coefficients in the
<a href="experiment_parameters.htm#Sedimentation Velocity Box">Experiment 
Parameter Box</a>, as the extinction coefficients will be part of the global 
model.&nbsp; However, all other information, including meniscus, bottom, optical 
pathlength and links will be recognized and entered as usual.&nbsp; Usually, I 
consider TI noise components also for absorbance optical data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>In this way, create an xp file for each signal of each cell, and save each 
experiment to the hard disk with a characteristic name (e.g. 
'ProteinA_cell1_IF.xp' and 'ProteinA_cell1_abs280.xp').&nbsp;&nbsp; (Do not use 
empty spaces in any part of the data path or filename.)</p>

<p>After that, remove all experiments, and load only the xp-files corresponding 
to the different signals acquired for <b>one cell</b>.&nbsp; For example, load 
the IF and absorbance xp file of cell 1.&nbsp; The xp-files that belong to the 
same cell will constitute one <b><a name="SET">'SET'</a></b>.&nbsp; </p>

<p><i><font size="2">It is possible to load several SETS, for example, you could 
load the sequence cell1_IF.xp, cell1_ABS.xp, cell2_IF.xp, cell2_ABS.xp.&nbsp; 
Note that all files corresponding to the different signals included in a single 
SET have to be loaded in sequence, and that the sequence for all SETS has to be 
the same.&nbsp; When multiple SETS are loaded, in analogy to
<a href="hybrid_local_continuos_global_discrete.htm">hybrid discrete/continuous 
model</a>, global parameters to all SETS will be s and D, the frictional ratios,
<b>and the extinction coefficients</b>. Local parameters will be the c<sub>k</sub>(s) 
distributions and concentrations.&nbsp; This will allow to utilize data from 
more than one cell in a global analysis. This can be used, for example, for a 
more precise determination of the extinction coefficients.&nbsp; </font></i></p>

<p>Consider <b><a name="linking meniscus and bottom for the multi-signal sets">
linking meniscus and bottom for the multi-signal sets</a></b>:&nbsp; Since the 
data are acquired from the same solution column, in principle the meniscus and 
bottom value should be the same.&nbsp; This is certainly true for different 
absorbance optical signals.&nbsp; It may not be true (and usually is not) 
between absorbance and interference optical data, due to the difficulty of a 
perfect radial calibration.&nbsp; Imperfect radial calibration of the IF system 
will create small offsets in the radius values, which (can usually be ignored in 
their effect on the measured s-value, but) require consideration of different 
apparent menisci positions for the IF and ABS data.&nbsp; This will create no 
further problem.&nbsp; After establishing links, make sure you update the xp-files 
with the function &quot;<a href="data1.htm#Save All Experiments">Save All Experiments</a>&quot; 
(or control-A).</p>

<p>Next, go to the Model menu and click on 'multi-wavelength continuous/discrete 
distribution analysis'.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/model.1.gif" width="444" height="437"></p>

<p>This will switch the multi-signal analysis on.&nbsp; A question will appear 
requesting the number of signals used in the analysis:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-2.jpg" width="213" height="106"></p>

<p>An algorithm is used to anticipate the number of signals - only two or three 
are currently implemented in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphaT</span>.&nbsp; 
(With commercial instruments, theoretically 4 signals can be acquired 
simultaneously, which may be included in the future.)&nbsp; It will be assumed 
that the experiments are in 'standard configuration', i.e. sequences of signals 
for each set are appended. If only one set is loaded (the example shown here), 
they are in 'standard configuration' by default.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-3.jpg" width="470" height="120"></p>

<p>Note that the signal of the first xp-file will be designated wl1, the next 
one wl2 etc.&nbsp; This numbering scheme for the signals will be used in the 
following as a designation for referring to the different signals .</p>

<p><u><b><a name="STEP 3: Analysis of Extinction Coefficients">STEP 3: Analysis 
of Extinction Coefficients</a></b></u></p>

<p>Make sure only the xp-files are loaded from the different signals of the cell 
containing one protein component alone, and that the multi-signal c(s) model is 
active.&nbsp; Click on Global Parameters.&nbsp; This will show the following 
parameter box:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-4.jpg" width="934" height="775"></p>

<p>Note that most of the sections of this parameter box are very similar to 
those of the <a href="hybrid_local_continuos_global_discrete.htm">hybrid 
discrete/continous global c(s) model</a>.&nbsp; Make sure you are familiar with 
those.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The different parts are:</p>

<p>1) the <a name="fields for the discrete species">fields for the discrete 
species</a>, for example species 1.&nbsp; s and M of the discrete species are 
treated as global parameters, while their concentration is local to each set.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-6.gif" width="141" height="150"></p>

<p>Checking the box next to 'species 1' means it is utilized, unchecking takes 
it out of the fit.&nbsp; M and S fields are like in the hybrid 
discrete/continuous c(s) model.&nbsp; New are the fields &quot;xt wl1&quot; and &quot;xt wl2&quot;, 
which are the molar signal increments (i.e. extinction coefficients) of this 
species for the signal designated &quot;1&quot; (the signal of the first xp file) and &quot;2&quot; 
(the signal of the second xp file).&nbsp; </p>

<p>2) The <a name="unit of the extinction coefficients">unit of the extinction 
coefficients</a> to be entered depends on the state of the box in the new 
section:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-11.gif" width="327" height="129"></p>

<p>This allows to define 'chromophors' or better 'chromophoric units' which are 
characterized by certain signal increments for both signals.&nbsp; For example, 
usually the chromophoric units will be the monomeric protein.&nbsp; The utility 
of the 'chromophor' is derived from the fact that it fixes the relative 
contributions to both signals, and that all possible species have signal 
contributions in multiples of these 'chromophoric units'.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For example, assume working with purified proteins that have different ratio 
of tryptophan and tyrosine, both proteins have a non-zero extinction coefficient 
at 280 nm, and data are acquired at 280 nm and in IF system.&nbsp; Assuming pure 
preparation, no species can occur that has signal contributions in the IF system 
only, and no species can have absorbance signal only.&nbsp; Further, the ratio 
of ABS280/IF signal cannot be lower than that of the protein with the smallest 
extinction coefficient at 280 nm.&nbsp; This requirement is a strong constraint 
for the analysis.&nbsp; </p>

<p>However, there can be exceptions.&nbsp; Consider that the IF data acquisition 
was superimposed by unmatched buffer salts.&nbsp; These obviously do not have UV 
signals.&nbsp; Therefore, it is possible to determine for the discrete species 
and the continuous distributions if their respective species extinction 
coefficients are expressed in multiples of chromophors, or not.&nbsp; In the 
case shown, the discrete species ARE NOT in multiples of chromophor extinction, 
while the continuous distributions ARE.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If you go back to species 1 above, you notice the effective M and s-values as 
they are usually observed for buffer salts.&nbsp; Signal 1 will be the IF 
signal, and the extinction coefficient entered is arbitrarily set to a value of 
1000000, which will arbitrarily scale the signal of the buffer salt (we're not 
interested in this magnitude).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3) the sections for the <a name="segments of continuous distribution">
segments of continuous distribution</a> - There are up to three segments that 
can be used, and they are switched on with the check-mark in the upper left 
corner (e.g., next to 'segment 1'):</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-8.gif" width="520" height="141"></p>

<p>The parameters for the sedimentation coefficient distribution are like in the
<a href="hybrid_local_continuos_global_discrete.htm">hybrid discrete/continuous 
global c(s) model</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>New is the matrix for specifying the spectral properties of the c(s) 
components for this segment.&nbsp; For each segment, as many distributions can 
be calculated as there are different signal types.&nbsp; In the example for IF 
and ABS280 detection, that's two distributions.&nbsp; However, at this stage in 
the analysis we have data loaded from the cell with only a single component, and 
therefore there will only be one distribution needed.&nbsp; Therefore, the c(s) 
segment with component 'spectrum 1' is switched on, and the c(s) segment with 
component 'spectrum 2' is switched off.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For each c(s) component, we need to specify how the species will contribute 
to the different signals.&nbsp; This is what goes into these fields:&nbsp; for 
each c(s) component (row) we will enter the signal contribution to signal 1 
(abbreviated here 'xt1') and signal 2 ('xt2').&nbsp; This can be EITHER directly 
in the units of molar signal increments (i.e. molar extinction coefficients), OR 
in multiples of the chromophoric units ('chr1' and 'chr2') as defined above.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In this particular example, the unit of extinction coefficients is set for 
the continuous segments to be multiples of chromophores (<a href="#unit of the extinction coefficients">see 
above</a>).&nbsp; Therefore, the value '1.000' in the column of 'xt1/chr1' 
indicates the fact that all species in this component of this segment absorbs 
exactly like the chromophore 1.&nbsp; The value '0.000' in 'xt2/chr2' indicates 
that there is no contribution of the kind of chromophore 2 (there's only one 
protein in the solution considered so far).&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4) <a name="Fitting the extinction coefficient">Fitting the extinction 
coefficient</a>:&nbsp; Notice that the definition of the chromophores and their 
signal increment includes check-marks for all fields.&nbsp; </p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-10.gif" width="327" height="129"></p>

<p>These permit the signal increments to be treated as floating parameters.&nbsp; 
Although apparently all signal increments can be floated, at least one signal 
increment has to be known and remain constant (otherwise the signal increments 
will be completely correlated with the concentrations).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Since we only use a single chromophore in the analysis of this single protein 
component, only the first row of entries is used.&nbsp; In the following 
example, we have loaded the data such that the first xp file is IF data and the 
second is absorbance 280 nm data (abbreviated ABS280).&nbsp; Therefore, the 
first column will correspond to the interference signal increments.&nbsp; The 
protein considered in the example it an IgG, and with Mw = 150 kDa, we get 
3.3x150000/1.2 = 412500 molar signal increment.&nbsp; The value of 100,000 is 
our starting estimate of the molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm, and the 
checkmark indicates that this will be floated in the analysis.</p>

<p>You can execute a <a href="run.htm">run</a> command to verify that no error 
message occurs.&nbsp; Also, different values for the extinction coefficient can 
be entered and the quality of fit compared.&nbsp; The <a href="fit.htm">fit</a> 
is done best in two stages:&nbsp; a) switch OFF the meniscus and bottom 
variation for all xp files, and DO NOT float the f/f0 value of the continuous 
segment.&nbsp; In this way, only the discrete species and the extinction 
coefficient are non-linear unknowns, and the fit will converge rapidly to a very 
good value for the extinction coefficient; b) fine-tune by switching ON the 
meniscus and bottom variation for all xp files, as well as the f/f0 value of the 
continuous segment.&nbsp; Both parts work better with the
<a href="fit.htm#Nelder-Mead simplex">Simplex algorithm</a> (i.e. in the
<a href="options.htm#Marquardt-Levenberg">fitting options</a>, switch Marquardt-Levenberg 
OFF).&nbsp; </p>

<p>My result is the following:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-12.jpg" width="973" height="770"></p>

<p>with xt280 = 206,740/Mcm .&nbsp; The green discrete species describes the 
buffer salt, and the red distribution all protein species with on average have a 
signal increment of 412,500/Mcm for IF and 206,740/Mcm in absorbance at 280 nm.&nbsp; 
In this determination we find that the main species is the IgG, but there are 
also substantial amount of aggregates and decay products.&nbsp; The information 
on the extinction coefficient is taken, conceptually, from the relative boundary 
heights in IF and absorbance detection.</p>

<p>One could wish for a determination of the extinction coefficients that 
excludes the decay products (&lt; 6 S) and aggregates (&gt; 9 S) from the 
determination of the IgG extinction coefficient.&nbsp; In this case, we set the 
fit up as following:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-13.jpg" width="934" height="775"></p>

<p>The discrete species is the IgG monomer, and now discrete species only are 
expressed in multiples of chromophore signal contributions.&nbsp; The continuous 
segments are specified directly in the form of molar extinction coefficients.&nbsp; 
Notice there are two continuous segments:&nbsp; segment 1 from 0.3 to 6 S for 
all species smaller than the IgG, and segment 2 for everything larger.&nbsp; 
Each segment has two separate component c(s), each one contributing only to one 
of the signals.&nbsp; This means that the two components now refer to IF and 
ABS280 signals only, which means that in this s-range the signal are essentially 
analyzed separately in conventional c(s) segments from analysis of the IF data, 
and from ABS280 data, respectively.&nbsp; The factor 100,000 is only introduced 
in order to scale the distributions.&nbsp; The result is shown here:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-14.jpg" width="973" height="770"></p>

<p>The red lines are the conventional c(s) segments from IF data (just scaled by 
100,000) and the green lines those from absorbance data.&nbsp; Only the discrete 
species at 7.2 S is considered to contribute to both data sets, which results in 
an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 210,754.&nbsp; This is only slightly 
different from the value obtained before, showing that the degradation products 
did not significantly bias the spectral analysis (most likely because they have 
very similar spectral properties).&nbsp; </p>

<p><i><font size="2">This second, alternative analysis also spotlights another 
feature of the multi-signal analysis.&nbsp; Although not relevant for the 
determination of the IgG extinction coefficient, a close inspection of the c(s) 
segments for the IF and ABS data reveals a number of differences.&nbsp; The 
presence of a small species only contributing to IF signal was anticipated as 
the unmatched buffer salt.&nbsp; However, the 6S and 10 S species also only 
appear in the IF detection, while a 5.5 S peak is only visible in ABS detection.&nbsp; 
It is highly unlikely that such species really exist in solution, and they are a 
result of the insufficient information in the raw data on the precise s-values 
of these trace components.&nbsp; This will make their identification difficult.&nbsp; 
In contrast, in the multi-signal analysis above the IF and abs contributions of 
these trace components were constrained to the same ratio overall, with the 
result of a slightly worse but still acceptable fit, which utilizes both signals 
to arrive at a globally consistent picture.&nbsp; </font></i></p>

<p><b><u>
<a name="STEP 4:  Analysis of Component Sedimentation Coefficient Distributions">
STEP 4:&nbsp; Analysis of Component Sedimentation Coefficient Distributions</a></u></b></p>

<p>After the extinction coefficients are determined for each protein component, 
the mixture can be analyzed.&nbsp; The xp files from the different signals of 
the cell containing the mixture are loaded in the same way as described above.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the following example, absorbance data at 280 nm are designated 'wl1' and 
IF data 'wl2', and we study a protein component with extinction coefficients 
220,000 and 657,433/Mcm for ABS280 and IF, respectively, binding to a protein 
component with extinction coefficients 217,000 and 466,130/Mcm for ABS280 and 
IF, respecitvely.&nbsp; This can be specified as follows:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-16.jpg" width="934" height="775"></p>

<p>Note that there is only a single segment, consisting of two components.&nbsp; 
The spectrum of component 1 is identical to chromophore 1, and the spectrum of 
component 2 is identical to chromophore 2.&nbsp; Both are assumed to have the 
same frictional ratio.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Alternatively, they could have different frictional ratio if they were 
defined as two different segments with 1 component each, like this:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-18.gif" width="517" height="273"></p>

<p>The global analysis gives two distributions, with the red line corresponding 
to component 1 and the green line to component 2, as indicated in the legend.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-17.jpg" width="973" height="770"></p>

<p>In this example, the protein designated component 1 consists of a monomer at 
6 S and a dimer at 8 S, and very little higher s-value if studied by itself.&nbsp; 
Component 2 has a peak at 9 S if studied by itself, and some larger aggregates.&nbsp; 
Clearly, in the mixture here the protein 1 is co-sedimenting with protein 2, in 
approximately equimolar ratio for the peaks at 10 and 12 S. </p>

<p>The distributions can be integrated using the shortcut control-I, and zoomed 
in and out using the right mouse button.&nbsp; This is completely analogous to 
the integration and zoom functions for distributions in SEDFIT.</p>

<p><b><u><a name="STEP 5: Application of Constraints for Stoichiometry">STEP 5: 
Application of Constraints for Stoichiometry</a></u></b></p>

<p>It is possible to apply additional constraints that reflect our hypothesis 
that all species &gt; 10 S are complexes, which have stoichiometries of at least 
1:1 or higher.&nbsp; For example, if we hypothesize from our knowledge of these 
proteins that there can only be species with molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2, up to 
1:3, this can be expressed as follows: </p>

<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-19.gif" width="518" height="273"></p>

<p>The first segment up to 9S describes the free components only.&nbsp; 
Everything larger is considered a complex, described in segment 2.&nbsp; Here, 
there are two component distributions - one for the 1:1 stoichiometry of 
chromophoric units (i.e. 1:1 protein complex, since the chromophoric unit was 
taken as the protein spectrum), and one for a 1:3 stoichiometry of chromophoric 
units.&nbsp; If there was a 1:2 complex, it could not be distinguished from an 
equal amount of 1:1 and 1:3 stoichiometry.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>More generally, these constraints are expressed as a change of the basis 
spectra as </p>

<p>In our example, the result shows four lines, two distributions from 0.5 to 9 
S, and two from 9.5 to 25 S.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Note that the protein concentration is the area under the curve.&nbsp; The 
transition point for the first and second segment is 9S.&nbsp; Since this is 
just where the protein 1 had a peak before, the red line is now rising to a 
positive value at the maximum of 9S, and the area under the red curve from 8 - 9 
S will approximately equal the area in the peak we saw before.&nbsp; Note that 
in this case, the appearance of a positive value of the distribution at the 
maximal s-value of the segment is not a problem, because larger sedimenting 
species are described in the fit.&nbsp; (They are just assumed to be complexes.)&nbsp; 
The second segment from 9.5 S to 25 S is almost exclusively populated by red 
species, which are the 1:1 complexes.&nbsp; Only a&nbsp; small trace of 1:3 
complex at 10.5 S appears.&nbsp; Considering that the fit is virtually equally 
good as the one before, it can be said that the data is consistent with the 
hypothesis that all species &gt; 10 S are a sequence of complexes, all with 
equimolar composition. </p>

<p>As in the <a href="hybrid_local_continuos_global_discrete.htm">hybrid 
discrete/continuous global c(s) model</a>, one can retrieve the local concentrations 
of the discrete and the component c(s) segments via the <a href="copy.htm">copy
command</a>.&nbsp; If you copy the distribution, you will be asked:</p>
<p>1) for the discrete species </p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/hybrid7.gif" width="213" height="115"></p>
<p>2) for each segment</p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-21.jpg" width="213" height="106"></p>
<p>and within each segment for each component:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/multi-22.jpg" width="366" height="153"></p>
<p>etc., which will put the corresponding section of the hybrid distribution into the
clipboard for pasting into your spreadsheet software.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Note that the component number when copying will not be the number specified 
in the parameter box, but they will be in sequence.&nbsp; For example, if 
component 1 was not utilized, and only component 2 was switched on, this will be 
copied by 'WL or Chromophore #' 1, instead of 2.</p>
