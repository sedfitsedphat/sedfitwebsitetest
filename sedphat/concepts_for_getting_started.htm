<h1>Concepts for Getting Started</h1>

<p>This tutorial assumes general familiarity with the experimental setup.&nbsp; 
For detailed information, see the
<a href="http://www.nih.gov/od/ors/dbeps/PBR/Applications/Protocols.pdf">experimental 
protocols</a> on the website of the
<a href="http://www.nih.gov/od/ors/dbeps/PBR/AUC.htm">PBR/DBEPS</a> at NIH. </p>

<p>As in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>, the basic
sequence of using S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span> is&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) load data</p>

<p>2) select the analysis model</p>

<p>3) enter starting guesses and fit&nbsp;</p>

<p>4) save and document results, save S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span> 
configuration </p>

<p>5) make statistical analysis of confidence</p>

<p>perhaps 6) re-analyze the data with alternative model</p>

<p>A little bit more detailed tutorial for the workflow with S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span> 
is available <a href="tutorial_for_getting_started.htm">here</a>, but I strongly 
encourage you to familiarize yourself first with the following terminology and 
concepts.</p>

<p>S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span> is a very flexible
platform for global modeling. Global modeling is very powerful but requires some
more thought about the different data sets, how to assemble them, and about the
fitting parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#FF0000">New in version 
1.9b:&nbsp; Two tools for enabling the storage and reproduction of results have 
been implemented:</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#FF0000">* saving global model 
parameters into files</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#FF0000">* saving the 
complete configuration of S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span></font></p>

<p>Note also that there are a some possibilities to customize startup defaults and model 
defaults. </p>

<p>Following are basic introductions to the general concepts.&nbsp; For more

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366"><a name="Data Channels ('Experiments')">Data Channels ('Experiments')</a><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>The major principle of organization is to use different data channels, or
'experiments'.&nbsp; They can be data from analytical ultracentrifugation or
dynamic light scattering, and be of different type:&nbsp;</p>

<p>* a <a href="data1.htm#Load New Sedimentation Equilibrium Data">single
sedimentation equilibrium</a> profile</p>

<p>* multiple sedimentation equilibrium profiles from the same cell at different
rotor speeds ('<a href="data1.htm#Load New Multi-Speed Equilibrium Data">multi-speed
equilibrium</a>')&nbsp;</p>

<p>* a set of <a href="data1.htm#Load New Sedimentation Velocity Data">sedimentation
velocity</a> data</p>

<p>* an autocorrelation function from <a href="data1.htm#Load New DLS Data">dynamic
light scattering</a></p>

<p>* an <a href="data1.htm#Load New Isotherm Data">isotherm </a>of 
weight-average sedimentation coefficients or molar masses</p>

<p><font size="2" color="#0000FF"><b>Please note:&nbsp; </b>The term 'data
channel' is more accurate than the term 'experiment' which is used in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>
synonymous to 'data channel'.&nbsp; The reason is that multiple data sets can be
obtained from a single sedimentation experiment, because the ultracentrifugal
cell can be scanned at different wavelengths or with different data acquisition
systems.&nbsp; The data at each wavelength would be loaded in a separate data
channel, i.e. a separate 'experiment' in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>,
although they are acquired from the same physical system.&nbsp; Similarly, in
dynamic light scattering autocorrelation functions from could be collected from
the same sample but at different angles - they are physically the same
experiment, but would be considered different data channels or 'experiments' in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>.</font></p>

<p>Each data channel in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>
requires information on the experimental parameters, such as buffer density,
viscosity, extinction coefficient, meniscus, bottom, fitting limits, expected
baseline parameters, etc.&nbsp; The complete set of this information can be
stored in an experiment file (*.xp), and later retrieved, thus simplifying the
process of reloading and reproducing the analysis, or re-assembling data
channels in different combinations.</p>

<p>Typically, several 'experiments' (*.xp files) are then loaded into different
data channels and combined in for a global analysis.&nbsp; (S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>
also functions well for single analysis.)</p>

<p>More details on how to deal efficiently with different experiments, load,
save, and remove them, and some examples can be found <a href="experiment1.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, many of the house-keeping operations, like copying data or setting
local parameters, etc., require specific user input to direct them to the
desired experiment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366"><a name="Local Parameters and Shared Local Parameters">Local Parameters,
Global Parameters, and Shared Local Parameters</a><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>Some of the experiments come with unknown parameters.&nbsp; For example for a
sedimentation velocity experiment, the meniscus position may not be known and
best treated as a floating fitting parameter.&nbsp; Other examples for
parameters that are specific to an individual experiment may be the baseline (or
radial-baseline profile), or the loading concentration.&nbsp; Such parameters
are referred to as <b>Local Parameters</b>, because they describe aspects of the
particular experiment (they are 'local' to that experiment), as opposed to the <b>Global
Parameters</b>, which describe overall aspects of the model independent of any
particular experiment.&nbsp; Examples of Global parameters are binding
constants, sedimentation coefficients, molar mass values, etc.</p>

<p>It is very useful to introduce a third kind of parameters - <b>Shared Local
Parameters</b>.&nbsp; These describe aspects of the experiments, like local
parameters, but they are shared by more than one experiment.&nbsp; For example,
if two data channels consist of sedimentation data from the same cell, but
acquired at different wavelengths, it is certain that the meniscus and bottom
position of the solution column are the same.&nbsp; Treating the meniscus and
bottom as a local parameter constrained to be the same in each data channel,
i.e. a shared local parameter, is very helpful to tighten up the model.&nbsp;
Another example of shared local parameters might be the loading concentration -
since the analysis is using molar concentrations, it has to be the same if the
data in two channels are from the same cell but at different wavelength.&nbsp;
(This permits to keep the extinction coefficient in one of the data channels a
floating parameter.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>More details and examples of parameters and their combinations can be found <a href="parameters1.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that part of the global model is the partial-specific volume of the
macromolecules under standard conditions.&nbsp; This is because the
partial-specific volume may be concentration dependent, or dependent on buffer
conditions.&nbsp; More no this issue is described under <a href="partspecvols.htm">partial-specific
volumes</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366"><a name="Selecting the Model">Selecting the Model</a><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>There are a variety of models, which can be grouped in three
categories:&nbsp; Those for non-interacting species, self-association, and
hetero-association.&nbsp; Note that not all models are implemented yet for all
data types.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The non-interacting models come either as continuous distributions, with
discrete species, or in hybrid models combining both continuous distributions
and discrete species.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Global analysis also raises the possibility for the models to be
distinguished as to whether they require the local concentrations of the species
to be the same in all data channels, or if the concentrations are local to each
experiment.&nbsp; The latter could be the case, for example, when different
physical experiments or different techniques are used, whereas the former could
apply if we're looking at different wavelength data acquisitions of the same
physical experimental configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Sedimentation equilibrium data have the additional
possibility to be
analyzed with mass conservation constraints, or without.&nbsp; They are fully
capable of global multi-wavelength or multi-signal analysis.</font></p>

<p>Model parameters can be <a href="data1.htm#Model">saved and restored</a>, and 
their default parameters can be changed.&nbsp; More on models can be found <a href="model.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366"><a name="Local Fits and Global Fits">Local and Global Runs and Fits</a>&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>After you select the model, you can apply it globally to all loaded data
channels, or you may want to look just at a single experiment.&nbsp;
Accordingly, the <a href="run.htm">Run</a> and the <a href="fit.htm">Fit</a>
commands split up into local and global versions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, when you decide to include an additional data set into the
analysis, you may want to first get the local parameters of this experiment into
a good range. This could be achieved without moving your global parameters if
you constrain the global parameters, float the local parameters, and then do a
local fit.&nbsp; This will adjust the local parameters to the best possible
values that is most consistent with your prior estimates of the global
parameters.&nbsp; After that, you may want to perform the global fit with
floating the local and global parameters in order to get the best overall and
utilize the information of the additional data set.&nbsp; This procedure will
avoid having bad local parameter values for the new data move your good global
estimates too far away from the optimal values.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>, S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>
distinguishes the 'Run' and 'Fit' commands:&nbsp; 'Run' will simply execute a
model and not optimize any of the parameters, except some of the linear local
parameters, like radial-dependent baseline profiles.&nbsp; This is in order to
allow you to test your initial estimates, and manually set them to reasonable
starting estimates.&nbsp; The 'Fit' command then does the non-linear
regression.&nbsp; This is important because the global models can be complex,
and the error surface may contain many local minima.&nbsp; As always in
non-linear regression, having good starting estimates is essential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For fitting, both the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and the
Marquardt-Levenberg algorithms are implemented (and can be selected in the
<a href="options.htm#Marquardt-Levenberg">options</a>).&nbsp; This is useful because the error surface of the
global model may be complicated, and non-linear regression non-trivial.&nbsp;
Having two algorithms helps to ensure that a global minimum has been
found.&nbsp; Usually, I use both optimizers sequentially to make sure they
converge to the same optimum and no further improvement is possible.</p>

<p>See also the reference site for the <a href="fit.htm">Fit</a> command.</p>

<p>For the statistical analysis of the results, both Monte-Carlo analysis and
covariance matrix is available.&nbsp; Dependent on the data and the models, both
have their problems and potential pitfalls (see the <a href="statistics.htm">statistics
menu</a>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366"><a name="Configurations">Saving the Configuration</a><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>The term configuration stands for the combination of a set of experiments, 
the model, the model parameters, and the links between the experiments and 
shared parameters.&nbsp; It is useful to save the configuration of S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span> 
in order to document the results, and in order to enable the precise 
reproduction of the current state of the analysis.&nbsp; Once a configuration 
has been saved to the disk, it's name appears in the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat </span>
window title bar, and it can be updated as the analysis proceeds.</p>

<p>A configuration on the disk is a ANSI text file, which can be edited with any 
text editor.&nbsp; For more details see <a href="configurations.htm">
Configurations</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366"><a name="Documentation of the Fit">Documentation of the Fit</a><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>There are no sophisticated printing or plotting capabilities in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>.&nbsp;
This is because everybody usually has his own favorite layout and plotting
program.&nbsp; Like in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>,
therefore, publication-quality graphs should be made by <a href="copy.htm">copying</a>
the data, fit, residuals, and/or distributions and pasting them into
spreadsheets in your favorite plotting software.&nbsp; (I have made templates in
Origin, but probably SigmaPlot or Excell can work nicely as well.)</p>
<p>An important tool to store results is to save the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span> 
configuration (see above).&nbsp; </p>
<p>For documenting the detailed fitting results, S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>
displays all relevant information as text output in the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>
window after fitting.&nbsp; I recommend maximizing the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span>
window, and using the 'Prnt Scrn' button to put a screendump bitmap in the
clipboard.&nbsp; Then, paste it into any word processing or other software as a
picture (I use Powerpoint, shrinking the bitmap to fit into a slide).&nbsp; Make additional notes there and save the whole
document.&nbsp; In this way, you can get all the details on different
alternative models saved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two tools for visualizing separately the contributions of each 
species to the total fit. They are controlled in the
<a href="options.htm#Lamm equation options for sedimentation/reaction systems">
Lamm equations option box</a> in the Options menu.&nbsp; They permit to 
temporarily manipulate extinction coefficients of species (and the profiles can 
then be extracted with the &quot;copy fit data&quot; function), or to save the molar 
distributions of each species to the harddrive.&nbsp; </p>
