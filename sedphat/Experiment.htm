<p><b>EXPERIMENTS</b></p>
<p>Sedphat organizes the data in 'Experiments', which are objects that consist
of the information of the experiment type, location of the data and list of data
filenames, buffer conditions, sample extinction coefficients, some centrifugal
parameters like meniscus, bottom, fitting limits, expected standard deviation
etc.&nbsp; Once an experiment has been defined, the complete information can be
saved (in a file *.xp) and reloaded.&nbsp; The functions for the manipulation of
the experiments are in the Data menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Data.h1.gif" width="347" height="361"></p>
<p>For global analysis, currently up to 10 such experiments can be loaded and
analyzed jointly.&nbsp; Relationships between some parameters of the different
experiments can be established.</p>
<p>The general strategy is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) load the data for a new experiment (Data-&gt;Load New ... Data)</p>
<p>2) enter the information in the Experiment Parameters box</p>
<p>3) specify graphically fitting limits</p>
<p>4) save the experiment as an xp-file (Data-&gt;Save Experiment)</p>
<p>For reloading a previously saved experiments, this simplifies to a single
step of loading the xp-file (Data-&gt;Load Experiment).&nbsp; A reminder will
appear to specify the partial-specific volume under standard conditions.</p>
<p>After loading an experiment, the data will be shown in the SEDPHAT
window.&nbsp; (Note that graphical input can be made directly in the graphs for
each experiment.&nbsp; However, a more detailed view is possible using the
'Display-&gt;Zoom Into 1 Data Set' function.)&nbsp; Each experiment has a number
associated, which is the order of loading which will be the same as the order
from left to right in the SEDPHAT window.&nbsp; Many SEDPHAT functions operate
on specific experiments, and the user has to specify the corresponding
experiment number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data analysis models permit global fitting to all active experiments
jointly, or alternatively, they permit a local fit to only a single
experiment.&nbsp; Experiments can be excluded from the analysis in two different
ways:&nbsp; They can be permanently removed from the SEDPHAT memory by using the
function Data-&gt;Remove Experiment, or they can be temporarily deactivated in
the Experiment Parameters box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all parameters are specified in the experiment
file:&nbsp; the <a href="PartSpecVol.htm">partial-specific volume</a> at
standard condition (water, 20C) is defined separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to edit the information of the xp-file of an
experiment.&nbsp; It is a text file, which can be opened and changed with any
text editor, such as the MS Notepad.&nbsp; The format of an xp-file is shown
below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</font></p>
<p>The individual entries are self-explanatory, except for a few entries.&nbsp;
The most important one, and maybe the only one that may require manual change is
the third line:</p>
<p><font size="1">C:\xladata\DC-SIGN\RR5B\XLADA302\eq 25k250_084.Ra1 20k251_052.ra1 15k250_030.ra1</font></p>
<p>This is the location of the actual raw data files.&nbsp; When moving the data
to a different computer or a different directory, it is usually necessary to
change the directory information appropriately.&nbsp; The directory is followed
(separated by one empty space character) by the data filenames to be
loaded.&nbsp; If you want to remove some data from the set, they can be simply
deleted here, but an according change in line 34 specifying the total number of
files is necessary.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most other parameters can be changed with the Experiment Parameter box from
within SEDPHAT (although you may want to save the experiment after the
changes).&nbsp; Exceptions are the values for MAXMENISCUS and MINMENISCUS etc.,
which are the constraints for the meniscus location when floating this
parameter.&nbsp; They can be changed from within SEDPHAT by switching the
fitting mark off, closing the Experiment Parameter box, reopening the Experiment
Paramter box, and switching the fitting mark on again.&nbsp; This will cause
SEDPHAT to ask for the constraints for this parameter.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The concentration values in the xp-file are just save the best-fit local
concentration.&nbsp; They are model-dependent, and are only partially used
automatically.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>LOAD NEW DATA</b></p>
<p>The Data menu of SEDPHAT allows loading of four different types of
experiments:</p>
<p>* Data-&gt;Load New Sedimentation Velocity Data:&nbsp; this is data from a
single centrifuge cell comprising the time-course of sedimentation.&nbsp; This
will be treated and requires information just like in SEDFIT.</p>
<p>* Data-&gt;Load New Sedimentation Equilibrium Data:&nbsp; a single scan from
one centrifuge cell in sedimentation equilibrium.&nbsp; Global analysis will be
accomplished by loading many such sedimentation equilibrium experiments. </p>
<p>* Data-&gt;Load New Multi-Speed Equilibrium Data:&nbsp; a set of scans from
one centrifuge cell in sedimentation equilibrium at different rotor
speeds.&nbsp; Requires all scans to be acquired at the same wavelength (and with
the same optical system, respectively).&nbsp; Defining data at different rotor
speeds jointly as a multi-speed equilibrium set, as opposed to using several
separate sedimentation equilibrium experiments has significant advantages.&nbsp;
It permits the use of additional constraints, i.e. mass conservation, same
meniscus and bottom position, and also permits the calculation of time-invariant
but radial-dependent baseline signals. </p>
<p>* Data-&gt;Load New DLS Data:&nbsp; Data from dynamic light scattering will
be treated just like in SEDFIT.&nbsp; Loading dynamic light scattering data in
SEDPHAT requires *.dlsdat data, which can be generated with SEDFIT from the
original data files.</p>
<p>Lateron in the analysis, some models permit to establish additional
relationships between these data sets.&nbsp; Currently implemented are links in
the sample concentration.&nbsp; This can be useful, for example, when
sedimentation equilibrium absorbance data are available from the same cell at
the same time, but acquire at a different wavelength.&nbsp; Because the sample
concentration has to be the same, the extinction coefficient for all but one of
these experiments can be treated as floating parameters. </p>
<p>For all of these types, familiarity with SEDFIT, its graphical user
interface, data input conventions and analysis modes is required, and will be
assumed in this help file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The specifics on how to load files is exactly the same as in SEDFIT, with one
very important exception:&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">file and directory names cannot have any whitespace
characters, such as a space or tab. For example, accessing from a directory
called &quot;<a href="file:///c:/xla%20data/eq">c:\xla data\eq</a>&quot; will
NOT work, but &quot;<a href="file:///c:/xladata/eq">c:\xladata\eq</a>&quot;
will.&nbsp; The same requirements exist for the xp-files and any other files of
SEDPHAT.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Experiment Parameters Box</b></p>
<p>This box appears immediately after loading new data, and can also be accessed
at any time from the top-level menu. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Experi2.jpg" width="567" height="471"></p>
<p>The first line specifies the experiment type.&nbsp; Line 2 shows the path and
filename of the xp-file and in parenthesis the filenames of some of the
experimental raw data.&nbsp; (In case the experiment has not been saved as an xp-file
before, the filenames of the raw data is shown twice, as in the above example).
Line 3 allows to enter any comments, such as sample ID, buffer composition, etc.</p>
<p>In the left half, there is a check box for making the experiment active or
inactive, which controls if this experiment will be included in the global fit
or temporarily excluded.</p>
<p>The noise field is the expected standard deviation of the measurement
error.&nbsp; Since the global fit will minimize the global chi-square, which is
essentially the ratio between the rms deviation of the fit and the measurement
error, a low value of the noise entry will make the chi-square of this
particular data set larger, and therefore makes its contribution to the global
fit more important.&nbsp; Therefore, this is the point where one can weight the
different experiments differently against each other.&nbsp; The default entry in
the noise field will depend on the data type.</p>
<p>The &quot;extra xp weight&quot; and the &quot;signal factor&quot; fields are
currently disabled and are likely to be removed in later versions.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side at the top are the specifics for the buffer
condition:&nbsp; partial-specific volume at experimental conditions, the buffer
density and viscosity.&nbsp; The default values for the latter two are the
standard conditions (water at 20C).&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><b>Note that all
parameters in SEDPHAT will be corrected to standard conditions.&nbsp; </b></font>This
is one of the main differences to SEDFIT, which (except for the inhomogeneous
solvent models) always reports results under experimental conditions.&nbsp;
SEDPHAT will always report s-values, D-values, etc. for standard
conditions.&nbsp; This is necessary because different experiments may have
different experimental conditions.&nbsp; SEDPHAT actually calculates with
parameters at standard conditions, and for each experiment translates them to
the experimental conditions specified in the fields of the Experiment Parameters
Box. </p>
<p>Below is a field that contains information on the centerpiece type (2 for
double sector, and 6 for six-channel).&nbsp; This information is used for mass
balance calculations.&nbsp; Next to this is the field for the optical pathlength
of the centerpiece.&nbsp; This is usually 12 mm, but short ones with 3 mm are
also sometimes used.&nbsp; For DLS data, these two fields can be ignored.</p>
<p>Some models for self-associating or hetero-associating systems use molar
concentration units.&nbsp; This requires knowledge of the extinction coefficient
at the wavelength of the data acquisition, or more generally a molar signal
increment (e.g., for interference optical AUC data with 12 mm centerpieces, it
would be ~3.3 times the molar mass).&nbsp; Current models have one or two
different components (self-association uses only species 'A', hetero-association
both 'A' and 'B').&nbsp; The extinction coefficients can be treated as floating
parameters (check the box next to this field) if the local concentrations are
linked to those of another experiment with known extinction
coefficients.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>At the bottom left are the different options for the baselines:&nbsp; a
single baseline offset, a different baseline offset for each file in the set (RI
noise, stands for radial-invariant noise), or time-invariant noise, which means
a constant but radial-dependent background profile common to all scans in the
set of this experiment. </p>
<p>At the bottom right are the fields for the meniscus and bottom
position.&nbsp; The values usually are graphically entered in the same way as in
SEDFIT, but they can also be specified numerically here.&nbsp; Important is the
check-mark on the left of the meniscus and bottom field, which indicate if this
is a unknown local parameter to be optimized in the fit.&nbsp; If that's the
case, the boundary constraints for the meniscus and bottom will have to be
entered in the message boxes that will appear immediately after closing the
Experimental Parameter box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Experiment Parameter Box is closed, for new experiments the fitting
limits should be set. This can be made graphically in the SEDPHAT window.&nbsp;
(Note that a more detailed view is possible using the 'Display-&gt;Zoom Into 1
Data Set' function.)</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to save the experiment after all the input has
been made.</p>
