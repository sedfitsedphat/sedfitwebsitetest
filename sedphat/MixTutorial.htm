<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The fourth step of this tutorial is the 
global analysis of the DNA and Protein mixture using data from the remaining 
cells of the AUC run.&nbsp; (Please refer to the
<a href="DNATutorial_2.htm#1) Experimental Details and Downloading Data">Experimental Details</a> to see the loading concentrations of the different 
cells)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We will use data obtained from the individual analysis of 
the DNA and the protein as fixed parameters in the analysis of the mixture to 
save fitting time.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><u>For the DNA</u>, the <b>apparent mass
</b>of 
23.9 kDa will be the value we use, in conjunction with the v-bar value of the 
protein of 0.743.&nbsp; (Again, the true molar mass is different, and so is the 
v-bar, but the buoyant molar mass determined by the product M*(1-vbar*rho) is 
correct (this is the important quantity), and by doing it this way we can work 
with the same apparent vbar for the protein and the DNA.)&nbsp; The <b>extinction coefficients </b>are 449100 OD/Mcm at 
260 nm (this was fixed to the theoretical value), 186,400 OD/Mcm at 230 nm, and 
269,600 OD/Mcm at 280 nm.&nbsp; These values will also be used as fixed prior 
knowledge for the multi-wavelength analysis of the mixture of DNA with protein.&nbsp;
</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>For the protein</u>, the <b>Mw value </b>is 9.3 kDa.&nbsp; 
This 
is within the usual range of precision, and we will accept the value of 9.3 kDa (and use it in the analysis of the mixture), continuing to use 0.743 ml/g as 
our vbar scale.&nbsp; The <b>extinction coefficient </b>are 4868 OD/Mcm at 
260 nm, and 8480 OD/Mcm at 280 nm (the latter was fixed to the theoretical value).&nbsp; These values will also be used as fixed prior 
knowledge for the multi-wavelength analysis of the mixture of DNA with protein.&nbsp;
</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial">Based on the protein analysis, we have decided to use only 2 wavelengths, 
280 and 260 nm.&nbsp; </font> </p>

they are loaded, and they will be referred to according to their number, 
therefore it's useful to load them systematically.&nbsp; In this tutorial, we

<p><font face="Arial">We are going to start with a Hetero-Association, single site model (A+B). 
Generally, for a mixture, it is a good idea to begin with this model.&nbsp;

correct model, we will begin here with the single-site model, in order to demonstrate why this model is not as good 
as the two-site model.&nbsp; This will give us more confidence for using the two-site model

constant to a good initial estimate.&nbsp; Association constants are in Log(10) of molar 
units, so to get into a range where the fitting algorithm will be able to 
optimize it,&nbsp;we will take into 
account our concentration range of microM (10<sup>-6</sup> ) and enter 6 here.&nbsp; 
sA,&nbsp; sB and sAB are sedimentation coefficients and are insignificant here.&nbsp; The

<p>
<font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="0510Tutorial2_files/MixABDisIinfo.png" width="697" height="563"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For the current experiment, we have no indication that 
mass conservation is violated.&nbsp; We would have noticed that when analyzing 
the protein and the DNA by itself, we would not have been able to get a good fit 
with mass conservation.&nbsp; Therefore, we can expect that it will be conserved 
as well in the mixture.&nbsp; This may not necessarily always be the case, for 
example, some protein may slowly precipitate or form a surface film at the 
bottom of the cell, slowly depleting the mass suspended in the solution column.&nbsp; 
In this case, mass conservation would not be valid.&nbsp; [Notice that the mass 
conservation only assumes that the material that was soluble at the time of the 
first equilibrium will still be soluble at the time of the last equilibrium, but 
it does not require the absence of some initial loss, for example, adsorption to 
the window etc.]</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">But even if mass is not conserved, it is a good idea to use the Mass conservation 
function in the global parameters.&nbsp; This will eliminate the reference 
concentration for each component and each equilibrium scan, and therefore 
considerably simplify setting up the global analysis and fitting it.&nbsp; If 
you don't use mass conservation, you have to provide initial estimates for the 
concentration of A and B at the bottom of the cell for <b>each rotor speed</b>.&nbsp; An example of that is in the 5 windows 
below as the local parameters are set up for exp # 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Don't 
do that yourself when you're following the tutorial...]</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="0510Tutorial2_files/MixExp1Local1.png" width="273" height="126"></font></p>

<img border="0" src="0510Tutorial2_files/MixExp1Local5.png" width="271" height="124"></font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Clearly, this would be very cumbersome [and difficult to 
estimate since the concentration at the bottom of the cell is usually much 
different from the initial loading concentration].&nbsp; If you need to fit 
without mass conservation, you can use an initial fit <b>with </b>mass 
conservation (and floating the bottom of the cell).&nbsp; After this has 
converged, switch mass conservation off, and you'll find that concentrations at 
the bottom of the cell have automatically been calculated based on your first 
fit, and you won't need to initialize them.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>

<p>
<font face="Arial">Common parameters for all 10 experiments will be the v-bar of the protein, 
0.7439, the buffer density, 1.003790, fitting&nbsp; for RI noise and mass 
conservation with rotor stretching.&nbsp; Here in exp# 1, we will fit for the 
bottom and enter the extinction coefficients for this wavelength (listed on 
line 2 of this window), values we determined from the single component analysis 
of DNA and protein.&nbsp; In theory, we could link the extinction coefficients 
throughout all of these experiments and fit for them, but if we enter them for each experiment 
and keep them fixed, it will be one less parameter we have to fit for, since we 
have determined them already.&nbsp; 
Also, these values are easier to fit for in the simplex fitting of the single 
component analysis.&nbsp; Note that we're making the approximation here that 
there's no hyper- or hypo-chromicity at the wavelengths used.&nbsp; [If that 
would be a bad assumption in the present case, one might be able to do an 
experiment with dual-signal analysis combining interference data with an 
absorption wavelength where the spectrum does not change.]</font></p>

redirect the bottom (after closing and opening this box again), the meniscus also becomes redirected even though we fixed 
the meniscus in the previous experiment - this is OK, since it is the same cell, 
and should also have the same meniscus value.&nbsp; With mass conservation, we are 
mostly concerned with where the protein ends up as it sediments away from the 
meniscus and lands at the bottom of the solution column.&nbsp; The meniscus 
position becomes insignificant and slight changes are tolerated.&nbsp; 
Therefore, the meniscus position does not need to be fitted for (in contrast to 
sedimentation velocity data, the meniscus position is frequently ill-defined by 
the data within our analysis range).&nbsp; Again, the meniscus is redirected, 
but it will not be fitted, since the value in experiment 1 was fixed.&nbsp;

<font face="Arial">On closer inspection now, it appears that some of the fitting 
limits are not optimally set.&nbsp; (For example, look at exp 3, 9, and 10.)&nbsp;
Lets bring in the bottom fitting limits a bit and repeat the fit.&nbsp; 
(Initially one can adjust the limits, even before doing any fits, such that the 
data do not exceed 1.5 OD.&nbsp; Having done a fit enables us sometimes to see a 
bit better where the data run into the region of optical artifacts close to the 
bottom, and should be discarded for that reason, even though they may have OD

that this model is possibly not ideal for this interaction.&nbsp; Also, notice 
that the for experiment 9 and 10, where we used the highest protein 
concentration in cell 7, the residuals are really poor.&nbsp; So, we are going 
to change to a 2 site model A+B+B, but before we switch we want to save the

a Kd in the micromolar range, and will float this value.&nbsp; For the second 
site, we leave the value log10(Ka2/Ka1) as it is...fixed at -0.6.&nbsp; In this way we will 
constraint the 2nd site to a macroscopic binding property of 1:4 with the first 
site, which is correct if the second site is microscopically equivalent to the 
first.&nbsp; This may not be perfect, but it is the most parsimonious assumption

Also, the best-fit values of the concentrations are getting closer to what we 
think we've loaded.&nbsp; Therefore, we will 
accept this model as better, and save this configuration as a fair comparison to&nbsp;

slightly, in order to eliminate data that may look suspicious.&nbsp; [We already 
made the decision that the two-site model was the correct one.&nbsp; For further 
refinement, we can justify truncating the data slightly for the further 
refinement and error analysis, as a conservative approach not to include data 
that are possibly affected by optical artifacts from too steep gradients or too 
radii too close to the bottom of the cell.&nbsp; Obviously, you don't want to 
exclude good data, and not exlcude reliable data that simply does not fit to the 
present model very well - this is a difficult judgment you have to determine for 
your given data.]&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">What we cannot decide from the data, however, is if the 
sites are equivalent and exhibit positive cooperativity, which would lead to Ka

macroscopic enhancement factor of 10^(-0.473) = 0.34 divided by the statistical 
factor of 0.25, leading to 1.34fold enhancement, i.e. the macroscopic Ka2 =

<font face="Arial"><b><a name="Step 18: Making different baseline assumptions">Step 
18:&nbsp; Making different baseline assumptions</a> </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">So far, we have chosen for all experiment to fit the data 
with RI noise, i.e. a baseline that is radially constant, but may change for 
each rotor speed.&nbsp; There are instrumental imperfections that may require 
you to use this option.&nbsp; However, frequently, a simple baseline ('fit 
baseline' only) will do.&nbsp; Further, sometimes you may need to use the 'fit 
TI noise' option, as well, which assumes that there as a radial-dependent 
baseline profile.&nbsp; The latter is good, in particular, when dealing with 
interference optical data [and very effective in the global analysis with 
absorbance data, as described in Anal Biochem 326 (2004) 234-256].&nbsp; You may 
want to do different analyses exploring the different options.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It can be a good idea to do the analysis with alternate 
baseline options, in order to verify that our conclusion of which is the right 
model, and the value of the best-fit parameters does not depend on the 
particular baseline treatment.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For example, we can turn on the radially-dependent baseline 
option (Ti noise) for each experiment:</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="0510Tutorial2_files/ABBfitTi.png" width="438" height="391"></font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="0510Tutorial2_files/ABBnEqTi.png" width="731" height="564"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Obviously, the fit is much better, since all the blips in 
the data produced by tiny scratches in the window are eliminated.&nbsp; As 
described in more detail in Anal Biochem 326 (2004) 234-256, we should make sure 
that the calculated TI noise (the black lines) are not systematically sloping, 
which would be unrealistic, and indicate compensation of an imperfect model.&nbsp; 
Also, we should make sure that the TI noise option does not introduce much 
flexibility in the parameter estimates, which can be done by inspecting the 
results of the covariance matrix (Statistics-&gt;Covariance Matrix).&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial"><b><a name="Step 19: On the statistical error analysis">Step 
19:&nbsp; On the Statistical Error Analysis</a> </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If we are convinced we have the correct model, and whish 
to extract error estimates, for example, for the binding constants, there are 
three different approaches.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">1) We could accept the estimate from the covariance 
matrix.&nbsp; This is usually not a good choice, since the errors are usually 
underestimated.&nbsp; (The minimum of the error surface is approximated by a 
paraboloid, which is usually not a good approximation for highly non-linear 
problems such as sedimentation equilibrium modeling.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">2) Monte-Carlo Analysis:&nbsp; This is seemingly the most 
rigorous approach, and implemented in SEDPHAT in the menu function 
&quot;Statistics-&gt;Monte Carlo for Nonlinear Regression&quot;.&nbsp; However, for each 
iteration step an automatic optimization to the new best-fit parameters is 
necessary.&nbsp; But strictly, there is no way to ensure that any optimization 
algorithm will really converge to the best possible parameters, which, 
unfortunately, makes this approach not rigorous at all.&nbsp; In particular for 
global non-linear models of exponentials, the error surface can be quite flat, 
and the automatic optimization may not be successful at all.&nbsp; Although it 
is possible to 'fix' that problem for interations where the best-fit results in 
obviously diverging parameters, but there's no way to ensure that the parameters 
that are seemingly close to the previous best-fit values are indeed the optimal 
parameters for the given iteration.&nbsp; This goes back to the well-known 
fundamental problems of non-linear regression algorithms that they cannot 
guarantee to give the overall best fit.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>As a result, the apparent 
rigor of the Monte-Carlo approach is invalid, and there is no way rigorous way 
to ensure that the returned error estimates are indeed correct.&nbsp; The more 
complicated the fit is, the more questionable the Monte-Carlo result will be.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">3) For a truly rigorous error estimation, there's no 
alternative to the manual exploration of the projections of the error surface.&nbsp; 
Find the best-fit, fix the parameter of interest to a value slightly off the 
optimal value, and fit to let all other parameters float and compensate the 
constraint.&nbsp; (If you find a better fit than previous, you know what I mean 
with the difficulties of fitting algorithm guaranteeing success - try to use a 
combination of Simplex and Marquardt-Levenberg fitting steps to further improve, 
and start over from the new best fit.)&nbsp; Observe the chi-square of the fit, 
which should slightly increase.&nbsp; Step by step, move the parameter of 
interest further away from the optimal value, and do this until the chi-square 
exceeds the critical value calculated by F-statistics.&nbsp; This is described 
in more detail on the SEDPHAT website.</font></p>
