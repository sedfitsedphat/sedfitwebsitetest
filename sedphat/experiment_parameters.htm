<h2>Experimental Parameters</h2>

<p>This box appears immediately after loading new data, and can also be accessed
at any time from the top-level menu.&nbsp; It contains those local parameters
which are more related to the physical configuration of the experiment.&nbsp; </p>

<p>How this box looks depends on the experiment type.&nbsp; Let's start with the </p>

<p><b><a name="Sedimentation Velocity Box">Sedimentation Velocity Box</a></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/experi2.jpg" width="435" height="418"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first line specifies the <a name="experiment type"><b>experiment type</b></a>.&nbsp;
This cannot be changed.&nbsp; (You could edit the xp-file, but I cannot see how
this might be useful.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second line shows the <a name="path and filename"><b> path and
filename</b></a> of the xp-file and in parenthesis the filenames of some of the
experimental raw data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Line 3 allows to enter any <a name="comments"><b>comments</b></a>, such as a sample ID, buffer composition,
or whatever you like to remember about this experiment.</p>
<p>Then follow a number of check-boxes and numbers. Starting from the top left
corner:</p>
<p><a name="Active"><b>Active</b></a>&nbsp;is a check box for making the experiment active or
inactive, which controls if this experiment will be included in the global fit
and global run functions of the model, or if they will temporarily excluded.</p>
<p>The <a name="noise"><b> noise</b></a> field is the expected standard deviation of the measurement
error.&nbsp; Since the global fit will minimize the global chi-square, which is
essentially the ratio between the rms deviation of the fit and the measurement
error, a low value of the noise entry will make the chi-square of this
particular data set larger, and therefore makes its contribution to the global
fit more important.&nbsp; Therefore, <font color="#FF0000"> this is the point where one can
determine how to weight the
different experiments</font> against each other.&nbsp; The default entry in
the noise field will depend on the data type.&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information, 
follow this link on the <a href="statistics.htm#measure for the goodness of fit">
measure for the goodness of fit</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a field that contains information on the <a name="centerpiece type"><b>centerpiece
type</b></a> (2 for
double sector, and 6 for six-channel).&nbsp; This information is used for mass
balance calculations in sedimentation equilibrium, which are dependent on the
cell geometry.&nbsp; Just below is the field for the optical <a name="pathlength"><b> pathlength</b></a>
of the centerpiece.&nbsp; This is usually 12 mm, but short ones with 3 mm are
also sometimes used.&nbsp; For DLS data, these two fields can be ignored.&nbsp; 
The field for <b>rotor type</b> can assume values of 0 (no information), 4 
(4-hole rotor), and 8 (8-hole rotor) [this information is used to correct for
<a href="#mass cons. w. rotor stretch">rotor stretching</a> in the Multi-Speed 
Equilibrium model.&nbsp; Following is the field <b>
<a name="no backdiffusion necessary">no backdiffusion necessary</a></b> - check 
this if the data are not influenced by back-diffusion from the bottom of the 
cell - this will automatically switch off the backdiffusion in Lamm equation 
solutions of reactive systems. </p>
<p>On the right-hand side at the top are the specifics for the buffer
condition:&nbsp; <a name="partial-specific volume at experimental conditions"><b>partial-specific volume at experimental
conditions</b></a> (see the <a href="partspecvols.htm">Concepts for Getting
Started page on v-bars</a>) the <a name="buffer density"><b> buffer
density</b></a> and <b> <a name="buffer viscosity">buffer viscosity</a> </b>(all 
at experimental conditions).&nbsp; The temperature field by default has the 
average temperature taken from the scan files, but can be edited and saved.</p>
<p>The default values for the density and viscosity are the
standard conditions (water at 20C).&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><b>Using the 
input about the experimental conditions, all
parameters in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT </span>will be corrected to standard conditions.&nbsp; </b></font>This
is one of the main differences to S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span>, which (except for the inhomogeneous
solvent models) always reports results under experimental conditions.&nbsp; S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span>
will always report s-values, D-values, etc. for standard
conditions.&nbsp; This is necessary because different experiments may have
different experimental conditions.&nbsp; S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT
</span>actually calculates with
parameters at standard conditions, and for each experiment translates them to
the experimental conditions specified in the fields of the Experiment Parameters
Box.&nbsp; (If you do not want S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span> 
to make any corrections, accept the defaults (pretend the experiment was already 
done at standard conditions, in which case no further correction will take 
place.)&nbsp; But generally it's definitely worth the trouble of looking up the correct
parameters - most likely you'll need the anyway sooner or later.&nbsp; Once
you've entered them here, save the experiment and you them stored with the data. </p>
<p><i><font color="#FF00FF">New in version 1.9: Once one experiment has been 
loaded, the default density, v-bar, and viscosity settings will be those of 
experiment 1. </font></i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving to the middle row of parameter fields, on the left we find the
baseline parameters.&nbsp; The <a name="fit baseline"><b>fit baseline</b></a>
checkbox will add a single parameter for a constant offset.&nbsp; For
multi-speed sedimentation equilibrium data, this baseline is shared for all
rotor speeds.&nbsp; For sedimentation data, it can be useful to check the <a name="fit RI Noise"><b>fit RI Noise</b></a><b>
</b>box, which adds a 'radial-invariant' offset for each scan in the current
experiment.&nbsp; This can take care of the jitter in interference optical
sedimentation velocity data, or some baseline shifts between the scans at
different rotor speeds in multi-speed sedimentation equilibrium data.&nbsp; The <a name="fit TI Noise"><b>fit TI Noise</b></a>
box switches on a radial-dependent baseline profile common to all scans of
sedimentation velocity or multi-speed sedimentation equilibrium data.&nbsp; This
can be used to account for systematic spikes in the data, caused by dust or
scratches on the windows in absorption optics, or by the common effects of
imperfections on any optical surface in interference optical data.&nbsp; The RI
noise and the TI noise are calculated by algebraic techniques, for an
introduction see the <a href="../systematic_noise_analysis.htm">S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT
</span>tutorial on systematic noise</a>. </p>
<p>In the center are is the section for entering <b><a name="meniscus">meniscus</a></b>
and <a name="bottom"><b>bottom</b></a> of the solution column.&nbsp; They can be
optimized in the non-linear regression by checking the box next to the
parameters.&nbsp; For DLS data, ignore these parameters (but don't optimize
them).&nbsp; You can enter them graphically, too, like in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span>.&nbsp;
If you switch on the optimization of meniscus and bottom, you will be asked for
upper and lower bounds for these parameters.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Please
note:&nbsp; set the upper and lower bounds carefully, as the default is not
always a good value and may constrain the fit to poor menicus or bottom
positions.</font> If you want to change the bounds for meniscus and bottom,
uncheck the optimization in the experimental parameter box, close the box,
reopen the box, and re-check the fitting marks for meniscus and bottom.&nbsp;
This will give you a chance to double-check or modify these values. </p>
<p>Just to the right is the field to <a name="redirect men./bot"><b>redirect
men./bot</b></a>, i.e. to copy the meniscus and bottom parameters from another
experiment and use them as parameters of the current experiment.&nbsp; For an
introduction to shared local parameters, <a href="parameters1.htm#Share Local Parameters">follow
this link</a>.&nbsp; You can switch parameter sharing on for this experiment by
checking the box, and entering the <a href="experiment1.htm#Experiment Number:">experiment
number</a> that should serve as a parent experiment (i.e. which provides the
parameter values) with regard to this parameter.&nbsp; Sharing will
automatically copy any option of the parent experiment to optimize or fix
meniscus or bottom.&nbsp; Sharing meniscus and bottom is highly recommended when
the data originate from the same solution column. </p>
<p>The bottom fields specify <a name="extinction coefficients"><b>extinction
coefficients</b></a> for a species A (default species in self-association
models) and a species B and C (used only for hetero-association models).&nbsp; Note
that extinction coefficients will not be used for the non-interacting
models.&nbsp; Enter the values in <b><font color="#FF0000">molar extinction
coefficients per cm</font></b>. (Pathlengths will be taken care of automatically
by S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span>).&nbsp; You can
optimize these parameters by checking their box, and you can also share those of
another experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Please note:&nbsp; You should not fit both the
extinction coefficients and concentration parameters, unless you have
essentially fixed one of them through sharing.&nbsp; For an example of
multi-wavelength sedimentation equilibrium analysis, see the <a href="parameters1.htm#Examples for global analysis and shared local parameter configurations:">examples
in the introduction to shared parameters</a>.</font> </p>
<p>For interference optical centrifuge data, substitute the molar extinction
coefficient with the signal increment.&nbsp; An example:&nbsp; We get ~ 3.3
fringes per mg/ml of solution with a 12 mm pathlength cell.&nbsp; If we have a
100 kDa protein, 1 mg/ml is 10<font face="Symbol">m</font>M. The specific signal
increment would be (3.3/1.2)*10<sup>5</sup>/Mol.&nbsp; In general, it would be
(3.3Mw/1.2), if Mw is the molar mass of the protein.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b><a name="Sedimentation Equilibrium Box">Sedimentation Equilibrium Box</a></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/experi3.jpg" width="437" height="438"></p>
<p>looks like the velocity box, but has fewer entries.&nbsp; RI and TI noise are 
disabled, since a single equilibrium profile cannot define these noise 
parameters.&nbsp; Obviously, in equilibrium the viscosity is irrelevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b><a name="Multi-Speed Equilibrium Box">Multi-Speed Equilibrium Box</a></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/experi4.jpg" width="438" height="443"></p>
<p>is like the sedimentation equilibrium box, but it can allow RI noise, which 
in this context is a Baseline that is dependent on the rotor speed, and TI 
noise, which stands for a radial-dependent baseline.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15003564">
Analytical Biochemistry 326:234-256</a>&nbsp; <font face="Verdana">(<a href="../images/SedimentationEquilibriumAnalysis.pdf">preprint</a>)</font> 
for how to use this option.&nbsp; The two fields 'TI noise rotor stretch' and 
'<b><a name="mass cons. w. rotor stretch">mass cons. w. rotor stretch</a></b>' will determine if the stretching of the rotor is 
taking into account for calculating the radial-dependent baseline, and for mass 
conservation, respectively.&nbsp; The extent of rotor stretching will depend on 
the <b><a name="rotor type">rotor type</a></b>, which can assume values of 0 (no 
rotor information), 4 (4-hole rotor), and 8 (8-hole rotor).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b><a name="DLS Data Box">DLS Data Box</a></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/experi5.jpg" width="444" height="246"></p>
<p>is much simpler.&nbsp; The fields have the same meaning as in the 
sedimentation models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b><a name="Isotherm Box">Isotherm Box</a></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/experi6.jpg" width="435" height="352"></p>
<p>is also similar to the previous ones.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice that you have to select the type of isotherm:&nbsp; </p>
<p><u>sw isotherm:</u>&nbsp; weight-average s-values, determined by integration 
of c(s) profiles of S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span> over 
all species participating in the interaction - this is for all models, 
independent of the time-scale of the reaction kinetics</p>
<p><u>Mw isotherm:</u>&nbsp; weight-average molar mass values - can be 
determined by fitting single-species model of S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span> 
to equilibrium data.&nbsp; This is also for all models, independent of the 
time-scale of the reaction kinetics </p>
<p><u>partial-conc. isotherm:</u>&nbsp; for <b>slow</b> interacting systems 
where the c(s) peak positions remain independent of loading composition.&nbsp; 
Data are amplitudes of c(s), determined by integration of c(s) peaks in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><u>Gilbert sw fast:</u>&nbsp; for <b>fast</b> interacting systems, which can 
be discerned from c(s) peaks showing peaks positions depending on loading 
composition.&nbsp; Data are the weight-average s-value of the fast boundary 
component in c(s), as determined by integration in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span>.</p>
<p><u>Gilbert partial conc:</u>&nbsp; for <b>fast</b> interacting systems, which 
can be discerned from c(s) peaks showing peaks positions depending on loading 
composition.&nbsp; Data are the amplitudes of both the undisturbed boundary and 
the reaction boundary component in c(s), as determined by integration in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span>.</p>

<p><b>The <a name="ITC data box">ITC data box</a></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/experi7.jpg" width="421" height="446"></p>
<p>Here, there are a number of specific entries referring to an isothermal 
titration calorimetry experiment, where one macromolecule is in a cell, to which 
a binding partner is added in step-wise increments.</p>
<p><u>cell conc [uM]</u>:&nbsp; This is the initial concentration of interacting 
macromolecules in the cell.</p>
<p><u>syringe conc [uM]:</u>&nbsp; This is the concentration of binding partner 
in the syringe.</p>
<p><u>recalculate concs:</u>&nbsp; The precision of concentration values in the 
raw data table exported from the Microcal ITC is not very high.&nbsp; (In part, 
this is because concentrations are in mM units, as opposed to the micromolar 
units used here.).&nbsp; The use of the ligand and titrant concentrations from 
the raw data table can lead to apparent oscillations and noise on the calculated 
isotherm, due to truncation of concentration values.&nbsp; Therefore, it is 
generally preferable to recalculate the concentration of ligand and analyte 
after each titration step, based on the total volume in the cell and the 
titration volumes in each step.&nbsp; </p>
<p><u>titration of:</u>&nbsp; Obviously, titration experiments can be performed 
in different orientations, even for a two-component interaction of A and B.&nbsp; 
In multi-site models, by convention, the molecule termed &quot;A&quot; is the one having 
two sites for B.&nbsp; This terminology is part of the model, and cannot be 
changed.&nbsp; Therefore, the identity of the molecules in cell and syringe must 
be specified.&nbsp; Clearly, this is crucial for<b> global fits of titrations in 
multiple orientations</b>.&nbsp; For three-component interactions, one can 
imagine using a mixture of two molecules in either the syringe or the cell.&nbsp; 
In this case, the molar ratio of the mixture needs to be specified.&nbsp; For 
ternary interactions where a reacting binary mixture is in the syringe, the 
complex formation in the syringe is taken into account.</p>
<p>The &quot;<b>fit baseline</b>&quot; field is straightforward - if checked this adds a 
floating baseline for this experiment to the parameters.&nbsp; The
<a name="ITCslope"><b>slope</b> </a>field will determine whether or not a slope 
will be fitted, in units of kcal/mol per injection.</p>
<p>The button &quot;<b><a name="ITClocal incompetent ...">local incompetent ...</a></b>&quot; 
will make the incompetent fraction of A, B, or C, respectively a local parameter 
for this particular experiment only.&nbsp; This can make sense if several 
experiments are fitted globally with data that were collected from different 
preparations or batches of proteins.&nbsp; If the box below the button is 
checked, the incompetent fraction will be a fitting parameter.&nbsp; The value 
given in the field is in fractions of total (i.e. enter a value of 0.05 instead 
of 5%).&nbsp; The <b>max</b> field is a possibility to limit the incompetent 
fraction.&nbsp; For example, if you know that at most 10% of material is 
incompetent, enter a value 0.1 here.&nbsp; This constraint for the upper limit 
of incompetent fraction is active only if the incompetent fraction is determined 
to be a local parameter.</p>

<p><b><a name="Surface Binding Isotherm Box">Surface Binding Isotherm Box</a></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/experi8.jpg" width="423" height="267"></p>
<p>The data-type specific parameters to be entered are:</p>
<p><u>surface conc. A:</u>&nbsp; This is the signal of <b>immobilized active A</b>.&nbsp; 
For example, this can be the difference in signal in RU before and after 
immobilization.&nbsp; </p>
<p><u>signal B/A and signal C/A:</u>&nbsp; It is possible to account for the 
fact that the soluble analyte B (or C) have different signal contributions, for 
example, due to differences in molar mass.&nbsp; In this case, set signal B/A to 
the ratio Mw(B)/Mw(A).</p>

<p>After the Experiment Parameter Box is closed, for new experiments the fitting
limits should be set. This can be made graphically in the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span>
window.&nbsp;
(Note that a more detailed view is possible using the '<a href="display.htm">Display-&gt;Zoom Into 1
