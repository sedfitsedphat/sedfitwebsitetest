<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366">Hetero-association models<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Note from version 4.0 and up:&nbsp; The appearance 
of the parameter input boxes for interacting systems will depend on the data 
type loaded.&nbsp; The goal is to simplify the parameter entry by eliminating 
irrelevant parameters . For example, enthalpy number are only required in ITC 
experiments, and kinetic rate constants currently only for sedimentation 
velocity.</b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">NEW version 2.0:&nbsp; All hetero-association models 
for sedimentation velocity can incorporate both slow and fast reaction kinetics.</font></b></p>

<p>This is in addition, to the previous implementation for sedimentation equilibrium
experiments (single and multi-speed) and for isotherms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Points to keep in mind:</b></p>
<p>* concentrations are in micromolar units, utilizing the extinction
coefficient A and B values from the <a href="experiment_parameters.htm">Experimental
Parameters box</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>* association constants are directly in log10 of molar units (for example,
for a value of log10(Kab) = 5 means K<sub>D</sub> = 10 <font face="Symbol">m</font>M)</p>
<p>* local parameter menu will be the effective loading concentration for each
experiment in micromolar units.</p>
<p>* incompetent fractions can be considered for component A and for B</p>
<p>* component B can be specified in molar concentration or in molar ratio</p>
<p>* a species not participating in the association can be specified (check the 
'add non-participating species' field) This is simply an additional component, 
perhaps an impurity, which has nothing to do with the associating molecules.</p>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">Note: because there is only input of a single
partial-specific volume, the molar mass values will have to be adjusted
accordingly to produce the correct buoyant molar mass.&nbsp; This is outlined in
detail in the <a href="partspecvols.htm#heterogeneous interactions">Partial-specific
volume page of the concepts</a>.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>All models provide the possibility of adding an additional species that is 
unrelated to the reactive species.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/self-a34.gif" width="150" height="115"></p>
<p>This can be used to describe, for example, a contaminant, or IF signals from 
sedimenting buffer salts.&nbsp; The presence of such components, and their 
estimated molar mass and s-value may be obtained from c(s) analysis with sedfit.&nbsp; 
The purpose of the vbar in this section allows this species to be used in a 
flexible way in density contrast experiments (e.g. to describe the free 
detergent micelle). </p>

<p>Currently (version 1.5) there are only 2 models: A + B &lt;-&gt; AB for the
reversible association of two components which don't self-associate and have a
single site, and a two-site model A + B + B &lt;-&gt; AB + B &lt;-&gt; ABB. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="Single-site heterogeneous association">Single-site heterogeneous
association</a></h4>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/hetero1.jpg" width="392" height="285"></p>
<p>There are separate fields for component A and B.&nbsp; If you check atot (or
btot, respectively), the loading concentrations of A will be floated in the
analysis.&nbsp; You need to determine the molar mass of A and B
separately.&nbsp; The extinction coefficient is shown here (taken from the first
experiment), but it will have to be entered in the <a href="experiment_parameters.htm">Experimental
Parameters box</a>.&nbsp; The fileds 'incfA' and 'incfB' are for the fraction of
incompetent A and B. </p>
<p>On the right, you can switch on mass conservation (if fulfilled) for the 
sedimentation equilibrium analysis.&nbsp; (I suggest to use this in multi-speed 
long-column sedimentation equilibrium experiments in conjunction with floating 
bottom positions.).&nbsp; </p>
<p>On the right is also the entry association constant; note that the default 
value for log10(Ka) is at 1, essentially switching off any interaction.</p>
<p><b>Obviously, the log(k-) entry only gains meaning for the sedimentation 
velocity models.</b> The log(k-) is the base-10 log of the chemical off-rate 
constant of the complex. Values of &gt; -1 (k- is faster than 0.1/sec) will switch 
the simulation to instantaneous equilibrium with mass action law fulfilled at 
all times and positions throughout the cell.&nbsp; Values smaller than -6 (koff 
&lt; 1x10(-6)/sec) will lead to sedimentation profiles nearly identical to those of 
independently sedimenting populations of the free and complex species of the 
loading mixture.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Below, you can switch to either have both A and B specified in micromolar
concentrations (this will be done in the local parameters menu), or A in
micromolar units combined with B being the molar ratio B/A.&nbsp; Dependent on
how the experiment is setup, you may have different cells with the same molar
ratio, hence in the global analysis you might be able to share molar ratio
parameters.&nbsp; Alternatively, if you have in different cells component A at a
constant concentration, you will be able to share the loading concentration of A
among these cells.</p>
<p>Everything else is the same as usual.</p>

<p>This is a good model for a component A which as two equivalent (or two
different) sites for a
component B.&nbsp; There can be cooperativity between the sites.</p>
<p>This is pretty much like the model before, except that there are two
association constants:&nbsp; Ka1 for the binding of a first molecule B to A, and then
Ka2 for the
addition of a second B to the pre-existing AB complex.&nbsp; Instead of using
two separate association constants, the model is expressed here in terms of a
macroscopic association constant Ka1 for the first binding, and the ratio
Ka2/Ka1 for the second.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, the off-rate constant of the ABB complex is expressed as the 
base-10 log of the ratio of the off-rate constant of first and second complex.
<b>Obviously, the log(k-) entry only gains meaning for the sedimentation 
velocity models.</b>&nbsp; If both off-rate constants are &gt; 0.1/sec, this will 
switch the simulation to instantaneous equilibrium with mass action law 
fulfilled at all times and positions throughout the cell.&nbsp; Values smaller 
than -6 (koff &lt; 1x10(-6)/sec) will lead to sedimentation profiles nearly 
identical to those of independently sedimenting populations of the free and 
complex species of the loading mixture.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Otherwise, the model works very similar as all the others.</p>
<p> For <b> equivalent sites </b> with no cooperativity, the log10 of this 
factor Ka2/Ka1 is -0.602.&nbsp; This is because of the statistical factors, 
which for equal microscopic constants produces a factor 1/4 for the macroscopic 
constants.&nbsp; Any deviation from this means that there is cooperativity 
between the equivalent sites.&nbsp; For the stability of the complexes, 
equivalent sites will lead to a factor 2 for the koff(ABB) versus koff(AB), 
because of the two possibilities to dissociate one of the ligands.</p>
<p><font size="2">In this way, you can make the analysis with the constraint that the sites are
equivalent (by fixing the log10(Ka2/Ka1) to the default -0.602, and by fixing 
the log(k-2/k-1 to 0.301).</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Note:&nbsp; Because Ka1 is the macroscopic constant and A has
two equivalent sites, the Ka1 is a factor of 2 larger than the microscopic Ka of
the simple A+B&lt;-&gt;AB model.&nbsp; Therefore, to get to the microscopic
binding constant divide Ka1 by 2, and to get to the microscopic cooperativity,
multiply Ka2/Ka1 with a factor 4. </font></p>
<p> Examples for equivalent sites are
antibodies binding up to two antigen molecules, or a receptor dimer binding one
or two ligand molecules.</p>
<p> For <b>non-equivalent sites</b> with no cooperativity, we determine the 
macroscopic constants Ka1 and Ka2 (Ka2 = Ka1*10^(log10(Ka2/Ka1)).&nbsp; The 
microscopic constants Kmic1 and Kmic2 are given by Ka1 = Kmic1 + Kmic2 and Ka2 = 
Kmic1*Kmic2/(Kmic1 + Kmic2).&nbsp; This will lead to macroscopic constants that 
are at least a factor 4 apart, i.e. our parameter log10(Ka2/Ka1) must be smaller 
than -0.602.&nbsp; This leads to Kmic1 = (1/2)*(Ka1*{1-sqrt[(Ka1-4*Ka2)/Ka1]}, 
and Kmic2 = (1/2)*(Ka1*{1+sqrt[(Ka1-4*Ka2)/Ka1]}.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Examples for distinguishable sites are proteins that just have to happen to
different binding sites for the same ligand, but the sites are at different
places of the same protein and have different types of binding interfaces for
the ligand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <b>non-equivalent sites with cooperativity</b>, the situation is more 
difficult and one will not be able to determine the binding site heterogeneity 
and microscopic cooperativity.&nbsp; Please consult Enrico DiCera's book 
&quot;Thermodynamic Theory of Site-Specific Binding Processes in Biological 
Macromolecules&quot;, chapter 3.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
