<h2>An example for the sedimentation velocity analysis with S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> </h2>
<p>The example given here highlights the potential of sedimentation velocity
analysis with S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>.&nbsp; Data
can be downloaded, and the results can be compared with those displayed, but
this will require basic familiarity with S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>
functions as described in the <a href="tutorial_sizedistributions.htm">step-by-step
tutorial</a>.&nbsp; <b>For readers who want to get familiar with how to do these
analyses, the <a href="tutorial_sizedistributions.htm">step-by-step tutorial</a>
should be consulted first.&nbsp; </b>Much more detailed introductions in
the theory of the analysis techniques are available in the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit
</span>help web, and will be referenced below.&nbsp; Similarly, references to
the websites explaining the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>
functions applied will be given.&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis can be refined by
<a href="export_to_sedphat.htm">exporting the data and the model to S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span></a>.</p>
<p>The data were acquired as described in the <a href="tutorial_ExperimentalConditions.htm#Experimental considerations">tutorial
section on experimental considerations</a>.&nbsp; It is a sample of IgG
molecules in PBS, run at 40,000 rpm.&nbsp; (In principle, a higher rotor speed
(55,000 rpm) could be used for studying a molecule of this size of IgG, but the
main concern in this experiment was to quantify the extent of aggregation.&nbsp;
Because possible aggregates might sediment much faster, the lower rotor speed
was chosen.)</p>
<p>A zip archive with the data (2,541kb) can be <a href="images/IgGdata.zip">downloaded
here</a>.&nbsp; In the following, for clarity we only load every third scan (of
a total of 226 scans), but for a full analysis, the complete set of scans should
be loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After <a href="sedfit_help_loadnewdata.htm">loading the data</a> (<a href="sedfit_help_loadnewdata.htm#every n-th file">every
third</a> of 1 - 226), we see the raw data,</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit86.gif" width="572" height="216"></p>
<p>which shows the typical time-invariant noise pattern, jitter, and integral
fringe shifts.&nbsp; S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> will
calculate these offsets by <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">systematic
noise analysis</a>, and we do not need to do anything about that here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="1">(Please note the large boundary movement in this set of
scans.&nbsp; This is useful for a high precision analysis.&nbsp; In fact,
ls-g*(s) should not be applied to small sets of interference scans where the
boundary has not yet cleared the meniscus, because of correlations of the small
s-values with the unknown time-invariant baseline.)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>First, we select meniscus, bottom, outer and inner fitting limit (<a href="sedfit_help_loadnewdata.htm#3) Setting the data range suitable for analysis">as
described here</a>):</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit87.gif" width="595" height="474"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example, we might want to look first at the g*(s) distribution, to
get an overview of the range of s-values.&nbsp; After getting used more to c(s) 
you probably want to move directly to the c(s) model described below.&nbsp; The 
point of this preliminary analysis is to provide a simple entry point for 
novices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We might first select the <a href="sedfit_help_ls-gs.htm">ls-g*(s)
model</a>, with a range from 1 to 15 S (resolution 100, P = 0.68).&nbsp; After
executing the <a href="sedfit_help_run.htm">Run</a> command, this results in the
following output:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit88.gif" width="595" height="474"></p>
<p>It is clear that most of the material is ~ 6.5 S, with a small amount
sedimenting at 9-10 S.&nbsp; We can <a href="sedfit_help_subtract_calculated_noise.htm">subtract
the systematic noise</a> by pressing ctrl-N, which will show the sedimentation
data clearer:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit89.gif" width="597" height="475"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Please note:&nbsp; If the fit is bad, this reflects the diffusional fluxes 
which are not taken into account in the ls-g*(s) model.&nbsp; </b>(This means
that there is a lot more information in the data that we didn't extract yet.)<b>&nbsp; 
At this stage, we can get a rough overview of the sedimenting species, but a 
serious ls-g*(s) analysis would require constraining the fit to a subset of the 
data.&nbsp; For more details, read the <a href="lsgofs_distribution.htm">
tutorial on ls-g*(s)</a>.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, we perform a c(s) <a href="sizedistributions.htm">size-distribution
analysis</a> with <a href="LammEqSolutions.htm">solutions of the Lamm equation</a>,
which takes diffusion into account by means of a weight-average frictional
ratio.&nbsp; Switch to <a href="sedfit_help_cs.htm">c(s) model</a>, and enter in
the parameter box a
range from 0.1 to 15 S (resolution 150, P = 0.68), with an estimate for the
frictional ratio of 1.5.&nbsp; This gives a good fit with rmsd 0.003
fringes.&nbsp; Subtract the systematic noise (<a href="sedfit_help_subtract_calculated_noise.htm">ctrl-N</a>),
and we see this picture:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit90.gif" width="596" height="474"></p>
<p>We can already see the main peak and some contaminations.&nbsp; The <a href="sedfit_help_residuals_bitmap.htm">residuals
bitmap</a>,&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit92.gif" width="1478" height="76"></p>
<p>shows a faint diagonal stripe, which indicates that it may be possible to
improve the fit further.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we <a href="sedfit_help_plot_range.htm">expand the view</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit93.gif" width="582" height="164"></p>
<p>we can see some deviations in the fit of the first couple of scans:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit94.gif" width="578" height="254"></p>
<p>which is the cause of the large residuals in the vicinity of the
meniscus.&nbsp; Therefore, in a second stage, we try to refine the analysis by
including the <a href="sedfit_help_loading_options.htm#Simulate Rotor Acceleration Phase">rotor
acceleration</a> in the solution of the Lamm equations, and we use the <a href="sedfit_help_fit.htm">Fit
command</a> to optimize the frictional ratio and the position of the meniscus
(we can temporarily switch off the regularization during fitting).&nbsp;
Ignoring effects of partial-specific volume and solvent viscosity, this
converges to a value of f/f0 of ~1.6 and a meniscus at ~ 6.071 cm<a href="#**">**</a>.&nbsp;
This optimization takes between 20 and 30 min on a 900 MHz PC (it takes less
time with fewer scans, e.g. every 10th).&nbsp; The rms
error is ~ 0.0026 fringes</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit95.gif" width="596" height="475"></p>
<p>The residuals bitmap is now virtually free of systematic deviations:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit96.gif" width="1478" height="76"></p>
<p><a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Data Tables">Exporting the distribution</a>
and plotting with Origin shows more details (with break in the axis):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit91.gif" width="518" height="423"></p>
<p>The s-values of the contaminating oligomeric species are slightly correlated
with the f/f0 value.&nbsp; However, they are very significant, as well as the
small fragment at ~ 0.5S.&nbsp; Relative concentrations can be obtained by
integrating the area under the peaks.</p>
<p>After <a href="sedfit_help_subtract_calculated_noise.htm">removing the
systematic noise</a>, we can <a href="sedfit_help_plot_range.htm">expand the
view</a> with the mouse,</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit99.gif" width="560" height="142"></p>
<p>and see in lower part of the boundary close to the meniscus the presence of
the small amount of low molecular weight contamination:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit100.gif" width="563" height="150"></p>
<p>as well as the slight back-diffusion caused by the small molecular weight in
the later scans close to the meniscus</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit101.gif" width="556" height="146"></p>
<p>(note the positive slope towards the bottom).&nbsp; Similarly, we can zoom in
to the upper part of the boundary&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit102.gif" width="560" height="144"></p>
<p>and verify the small portion of rapidly sedimenting material in the slightly
skewed shape of the shoulder.&nbsp; Finally, we can look at the middle part of
the boundaries</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit103.gif" width="563" height="146"></p>
<p>and see that the diffusional spreading (decreasing slope) is well modeled.</p>
<p><b>It should be noted that the full analysis of these data will have threefold
higher density of scans (left out here for clarity).&nbsp; This shows the level
of detailed information that can be extracted from sedimentation velocity analysis by
direct boundary modeling.</b></p>
<p>Switching to the <a href="sedfit_help_cm.htm">c(M) distribution</a> gives a
gross estimate of molar mass distribution, which is valuable predominantly for
the main species (as this governs the weight-average f/f0), less so for the
oligomeric species:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit97.gif" width="575" height="165"></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i><b>NEW:&nbsp; The distribution plot can now be
expanded in sedfit by using the new command for <a href="sedfit_help_display.htm#Rescale Distribution Plot">rescaling
the distribution plot</a> in the distribution menu. Also, using the new <a href="sedfit_help_size_distribution_options.htm#Integrate Distribution">integration
tool</a>, we can calculate the loading concentration and weight-average s-value
under each of the peaks.</b></i></font></p>
<p>After having identified the number of the components, we can now make use of
our knowledge that we have actually discrete species in solution.&nbsp; We can
switch to the <a href="sedfit_help_independent_ideal_species.htm">non-interacting
discrete
species model</a>, and use the s-values of the peaks from the c(s) analysis as
starting guesses.&nbsp; We can fix the monomer, dimer and trimer molar masses
(for simplicity approximating the effective monomer molar mass by 150kDa -- of
course if known, this should be substituted by the true molar mass of the
monomer, and the <a href="sedfit_help_set_vbarxrho.htm">partial-specific volume
and buffer density</a> should be entered), and float the s-values and
concentrations of all species, as well as the molar mass of the small
species.&nbsp; For this analysis, we load the complete set of 226 scans (in this
model, a large number of scans does not slow the analysis down much, as in the
distribution models - although it slows down the display).&nbsp; Also, we
include the meniscus position as a floating parameter.&nbsp; </p>
<p>[For a more general method to analyze discrete species in combination with 
continuous segments, or for discrete species the unknown molar masses of known 
oligomeric series, see the
<a href="sedphat/hybrid_local_continuos_global_discrete.htm">SEDPHAT hybrid 
discrete/continuous model</a>]. </p>
<p>We get the following fit, which suggests we have a total loading
concentration of 0.359 fringes, and of this ~ 3% dimer, ~1% trimer, and 6%
small Mw contamination.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit104.gif" width="722" height="556"></p>
<p>The rms error is 0.002612 <a href="#***">***</a>, very close to that of the
c(s) analysis, which confirms that the peaks found in c(s) are indeed
macromolecules that sediment as discrete species.&nbsp; Like before, the
residuals bitmap shows very little systematics,</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit105.gif" width="1503" height="226"></p>
<p>even if we use a scale of 0.01 for max black to white (instead of the default
0.05 max scale).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/sedfit106.gif" width="1503" height="226"></p>
<p><font size="1">The remaining patterns of vertical and horizontal lines are
due to small vibrations and very small drifts in the interference optics
producing systematic errors that are not described by RI and TI noise, showing
limitations of stability of the commercial instrument.</font>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, we could ask if the 1% trimer is really statistically
significant.&nbsp; For this, we can use the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>
<a href="sedfit_help_calculator.htm#Calculate F-distribution">calculator</a> to
get from <a href="sedfit_help_fstatistics.htm">F-statistics</a> the rmsd cutoff
for the 340,000 data points that corresponds to one standard deviation (P =
0.68).&nbsp; We find that all fits with an rmsd higher than 0.002614 is
statistically significantly worse (on a confidence level of one standard
deviation).&nbsp; If we switch off the
trimer component and refit the data, the fit converges at an rms value of
0.002686, which shows that the 1% of trimer is statistically highly
significant.&nbsp; <i>Note that this does not apply to the s-value, which is not
well-determined, but the existence of an oligomer larger than the dimer</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next question one might ask is what is the
precision of the s-value of the main component.&nbsp; We use the '<a href="sedfit_help_confidence_intervals.htm">confidence
interval for s</a>' function of S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>,
which performs a series of fits constraining s1 to non-optimal values (we choose
a test interval of 0.002, and a confidence level of 68%).&nbsp; The cutoff
s-value will be reached when the rmsd of the fit is larger than 0.002614.&nbsp;
For this analysis, we also should let the meniscus position float, as this
parameter will be correlated with the sedimentation coefficients (and we don't
know for sure that the previous best-fit meniscus is the true one).&nbsp; If the
molar mass has some uncertainty, it should also been floated (for simplicity, we
assume in this example that we know the molar masses of all but the small
component).&nbsp; This takes a while because of the large number of scans and
floating parameters (after a few tests to make sure everything is running OK, I
did this analysis overnight).&nbsp; In the end, we get a confidence interval of [6.572 -
6.623] (or approximately +/- 0.026 with a slight asymmetry), which corresponds
to a relative error of&nbsp; ~0.4%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#800080"><b><u>New in version 8.7:</u></b>&nbsp; Please note
that corrections for solvent compressibility are now available.&nbsp; For using
those, please read the <a href="file:///C:/peter/website/sedfithelpweb/inhomogeneous_solvent.htm">specific
instructions</a> for this S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit </span>mode.
They have not been included in the above tutorial, yet.&nbsp; For the c(s)
distribution with solvent compressibility, this will mean that the s-values are
corrected to standard conditions (water 20C), and that the buffer viscosity and
density in the input boxes will refer to standard conditions.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An alternative analysis for cases where we do not want to make the assumption 
of discrete species, we can look at the c(s,f/f0) analysis.&nbsp; This produces 
the following result:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit26.jpg" width="936" height="641"></p>
<p>In the absence of the knowledge of discrete species, the molar mass 
assignment to the trace components cannot be made, but the molar mass of the 
major component can be well-determined without any scale-relationship 
approximation:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit27.jpg" width="671" height="562"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="1">Footnotes:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="1"><a name="**">**</a>&nbsp; At first, this meniscus position seems
to be a little bit
outside the range where it would be graphically estimated at this stage based on
the appearance of the optical artifacts.&nbsp; However, it should be noted that
after systematic noise has been subtracted, no judgment about the meniscus
position can be made.&nbsp; If we take the best-fit meniscus position and
compare it with the raw data, it does indeed look like a possible value:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="1"><img border="0" src="images/sedfit98.gif" width="528" height="197"></font></p>
<p><font size="1">Only the fact that this part of the meniscus artifact is
similar in all scans has made it 'disappear' when subtracting the best-fit TI

reliable results, in particular when the data are acquired over the complete
sedimentation process.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="1"><a name="***">***</a> If the rms error is not exactly
