 </p>
<p>This function is for studying the statistical confidence limits in <a href="sizedistributions.htm#Tikhonov-Phillips versus maximum entropy regularization, and the use of Monte-Carlo statistics">
distribution analyses</a>. The idea of the Monte-Carlo analysis is the generation of
a large number (e.g. 100 - 1000) synthetic data sets that are similar to the
experimental data set, but each with different random normally distributed
noise. Each of these new data sets is analyzed, and the distributions are
stored. The resulting set of distributions can then be studied, point by point,
and the mean and probability contours can be calculated.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In essence, the Monte-Carlo statistics allows to build up a probability
distribution function, and allows to study how much the noise of the data is
translated into the distribution. As a consequence, the Monte-Carlo procedure
can be useful for investigating what features of the distribution are a result
of noise in the data, and what features are essential for describing the data.&nbsp;
Two main features are highlighted in the implementation of S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>:&nbsp;
The confidence contours of the distribution (i.e., it's shape), and the integral
(weight-average s-values and loading concentrations across a peak or in a
region).</p>
<p>The underlying assumption made in the current implementation is that the
best-fit distribution represents the 'true' data well enough, so that the
effects of noise in the simulated data and in the real data are the same.&nbsp;
A second assumption made is that the error distribution of each data point is
Gaussian. </p>
<p>The procedure is implemented here as follows:</p>
<p>1) with a distribution model, the best fitted values for all data points are
stored. <i><u><font COLOR="#ff0000">Important:</font></u><font COLOR="#ff0000">
The best-fit distribution has to be found before executing the Monte-Carlo
analysis, and the residuals should be random and show no systematics
</font></i>
(this may be assessed, for example, by the <a href="sedfit_help_fstatistics.htm#Runs Test">runs
test</a>, or by looking at the <a href="sedfit_help_residuals_bitmap.htm">residuals
bitmap</a>).&nbsp; The best-fit found (automatically without regularization) 
will be taken as reference for generating new distributions.</p>
<p>2) the number of iterations <i>N</i> must be specified. It is suggested to
perform a ‘test’ Monte-Carlo with a small (e.g. 10-100) number of
iterations, first, to check the performance of the procedure, and then make a
large statistics (100-1000) overnight.</p>
<p>3) The confidence level: After calculating the <i>N </i>new distributions
based on the <i>N </i>generated data sets, the distribution plot will show 3
curves, the mean curve in black, and a blue and a red curve, which enclose a
specified percentile of the data. For example, if the confidence level is 0.7,
then the middle 70% is enclosed by the 0.15 (in blue) and the 0.85 (in red)
quantile. Setting this confidence level changes these percentiles of the display
and storage.</p>
<p>4) A directory for the storage of the calculated distributions has to be
specified. This will contain <i>N</i> distributions, named 1.dat,2.dat,...,N.dat,
as well as a distribution called &quot;mean.dat&quot;, and different percentiles
called &quot;lim***.dat&quot;, e.g. lim160.dat for the 16% percentile.</p>
<p>5) The calculation of the Monte-Carlo iterations follows. Synthetic data sets
are generated based on the previously found best-fit data (see point 1 above),
with normally distributed noise added in the same magnitude as was obtained in
the previous best-fit. Each of these new data sets is analyzed in the same way
as the original distribution analysis. Each new calculated distribution is
stored in memory, and in a file (see point 3 above).</p>
<p>6) The statistics of the curves is analyzed: As described in point 3, the
mean and specified quantiles of the distributions are shown. For example, if the
confidence level was 0.68, the curves shown in the display are the mean and 1
standard deviation contour for each point in the distribution. A continuous loop
allows to probe new confidence levels, each of which will subsequently be
displayed and stored in the specified directory. This way, a complete
statistical analysis can be performed, without any need to re-calculate the
Monte-Carlo iterations. This loop is stopped by pressing the ‘cancel’
button.</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b><a name="MC for sw">New in version 8.7:&nbsp; Monte-Carlo for
integrated weight-average s values</a></b></font></p>
<p>This is a better statistics to use for determining the precision of the
weight-average s-values across a peak or in a region.&nbsp; For example, when
analyzing low concentrations of aggregate contaminations, the concentration may
be too low to precisely locate the peak, yet the presence of material in a given
s-range may be highly significant.&nbsp; In such a case, the confidence contours
for the distribution may reach zero everywhere in the s-interval, but the
integral across the region may be precisely determined and non-zero.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In this variation, after specifying the confidence level, the lower limit for
the integration range and then the upper limit for the integration range needs
to be specified. The output message box the will report the average sw value,
it's 68% confidence interval, the average deviation, and the standard deviation
of the samples.&nbsp; It will also report the average concentration in the
integrated interval and its confidence interval. After closing the results
message box, different integration limits can be chosen (no need to recalculate
the Monte-Carlo simulations, just different statistical analysis of the result).</p>
