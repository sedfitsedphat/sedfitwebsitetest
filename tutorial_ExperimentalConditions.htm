<p><b><u><a name="Experimental considerations">Experimental considerations</a></u></b></p>
<p>For a detailed direct boundary analysis, there are a few requirements that
need to be taken into account before doing the experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This tutorial assumes general familiarity with the experimental setup.&nbsp; 
For detailed information, see the
<a href="http://www.nih.gov/od/ors/dbeps/PBR/Applications/Protocols.pdf">experimental 
protocols</a> on the website of the
<a href="http://www.nih.gov/od/ors/dbeps/PBR/AUC.htm">PBR/DBEPS</a> at NIH. </p>
<p>One of the most important points is that the rotor is thoroughly equilibrated
with respect to temperature in order to avoid convection.&nbsp; (If you have
convection, the only rigorous analysis methods possible are the <a href="sedfit_help_SetInitialData.htm">Lamm
equation initialized with an experimental scan</a> [single macromolecular
component only], or the <a href="sedfit_help_calculator.htm#Differential second moment integration">differential
second moment method </a>[gives sw only].) I had most
success with the following procedure:&nbsp; After inserting the rotor and the
optics into the ultracentrifuge, I set the desired temperature on the control
panel and start evacuating the rotor chamber.&nbsp; Note that the temperature
reading of the rotor may not be very accurate, and there can be a large jump
when the vacuum goes below 100 micron.&nbsp; I do <b>not</b> start the rotor
yet.&nbsp; With the rotor sitting at zero rpm, I observe the rotor
temperature.&nbsp; If the vacuum is far below 100 micron, and the reading of the
rotor temperature coincides with the set-point of the temperature, I wait 1 hour
to have good thermal equilibration of the rotor, before I start the run.&nbsp;
Please note that there is no 3000 rpm phase, because sedimentation at the low
rpm although small, dependent on the system studied, may lead to boundary
deformations and propagate systematic error into the data.&nbsp; (This is
apparently not as important for methods like g(s*), which primarily use the <font face="Symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup>t
information from the files, and do not model the shape of the boundary).&nbsp;
If an initial phase at low rotor speed is needed (e.g. for setting up the
optics), make sure to stop the run, shake the cells up, and restart the
run.&nbsp; Unfortunately, usually that increases the rotor temperature by a few
degrees, so that thermal equilibration must be reestablished by waiting at zero
rotor speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the rotor acceleration at the maximal setting, as during the
acceleration clearly sedimentation takes place (this can be easily observed with
the interference optical system).&nbsp; Although S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> 
can calculate the Lamm equation solutions with a uniform acceleration (<a href="sedfit_help_loading_options.htm#Simulate Rotor Acceleration Phase">see
Loading Options</a>), it seems best to approximate as good as possible the ideal
assumption of instantaneous acceleration to the full speed.</p>
<p>Scanning should be started as soon as possible, because the complete
sedimentation process is informative and important for an optimal
analysis.&nbsp; In direct boundary modeling, there is no need for the molecules
to clear the meniscus.&nbsp; If setting up the parameters in the control
software of the optics is complicated, it should be done before the start of the
run (and cells should be mixed after that before starting the run).&nbsp;
Similarly, the scans should proceed until the sedimentation is complete, i.e.
until the smallest species vanishes into the optical artifacts in the bottom
region.&nbsp; Unless it is known that the sedimentation is very slow, I usually
set the scan rate to the highest possible value.&nbsp; It is not recommended to
use Sedfit for the analysis of small data subsets, for example those in the
early part of the sedimentation, as this will only have limited information.</p>
<p>Besides these considerations how to do the ultracentrifuge run, there are
also requirements for the sample in order to apply c(s) analysis.&nbsp; Because
c(s) is based on Lamm equation solutions describing mixtures of independent
ideally sedimenting species, the sample should not exhibit non-ideal
sedimentation (i.e. concentration-dependent s and D), and should not be in rapid
association equilibrium.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example data set with BSA suspended in phosphate buffered saline is
described in the following, and can be downloaded <a href="images/bsa.zip">here</a>.&nbsp;
Please note that in this particular example, the experiment was not conducted to
completion, and ideally one would want to have approximately double the number
of scans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This data was acquired with the interference optics.&nbsp; Most of the
following will be the same with absorbance data, with the exception of the few
steps regarding the <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">subtraction of
systematic noise</a>&nbsp; (although, occasionally, this can be useful for
absorbance data, too).</p>
