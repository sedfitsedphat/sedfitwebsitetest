<p><u><a name="introduction"><b>Introduction to g*(s) analysis</b></a></u></p>
<p>The g*(s) analysis has been very popular over the last several years in the
form of a data transform derived from dcdt.&nbsp; One of the virtues of this
method (as opposed to the calculation of g*(s) from the radial derivative dc/dr)
is that the time-difference dc/dt eliminates the time-invariant noise usually
encountered in interference optical data.&nbsp; One difficulty in practice is
that dcdt is approximated by <font face="Symbol">D</font>c/<font face="Symbol">D</font>t,
which imposes the well-known constraints on the number of scans, steepness of
the sedimentation boundary analyzed, and the magnitude of the displacements
between scans, and which can even lead to distortions of the distribution for
small molecular weights.&nbsp; With the development of&nbsp; <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">systematic
noise decomposition</a> we can calculate the same g*(s) distribution
differently, in the form of a direct boundary model and using least-squares
principles.&nbsp; This will be described in the following, and it will be shown
below that this approach eliminates some of the constraints. </p>
<p>The distribution is termed ls-g*(s) to indicate the least-squares basis of
the analysis.&nbsp; In contrast to the dcdt strategy, there is no transformation
of the radial variable into a s*, therefore we call it ls-g*(s) instead of
g(s*).&nbsp; The star in g*(s) indicates that it is an <i>apparent</i>
sedimentation coefficient distribution, meaning that diffusion is not taken into
account.&nbsp; This is certainly a good model for very large molecules when
diffusion is negligible on the time-scale of the velocity experiment.&nbsp; For
smaller molecules, diffusion can be taken into account by using the <a href="sedfit_help_cs.htm">c(s)
method</a>, but this is not done in the ls-g*(s) approach.&nbsp; As a
consequence, the sedimentation coefficient distribution is broadened by
diffusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Diffusional broadening can, in principle, be analyzed at a later stage by
fitting Gaussians to the g*(s) distribution.&nbsp; However, this is not always very
precise, as the Gaussians are based on the <a href="exampleFaxen.htm">Faxén
approximation</a> of the Lamm equation (see the discussion in <a href="#ref number 1">ref
1</a>).&nbsp; For quantitative analysis, more precise is modeling of the
original sedimentation data on the basis of numerical <a href="LammEqSolutions.htm">Lamm
equation solutions</a> (for example, using the <a href="sedfit_help_independent_ideal_species.htm">independent
species model</a> of S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit)</span>, or
modeling dc/dt using the approximate analytical solutions of the Lamm equation
(e.g. with <a href="http://www.jphilo.mailway.com/"> John Philo's
software</a> (<a href="#ref 4">ref 4</a>)).&nbsp; However, in my view, the strength of the apparent sedimentation
coefficient distribution is not so much the quantitative analysis, but that it
can be very descriptive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If we understand the g*(s) distribution as a data transformation (this
attribute can be assigned with equal justification to the g(s*) and the ls-g*(s)
distribution), then we can apply it in a descriptive sense to any sedimentation
data, even if there are chemical reactions or other concentration-dependent
sedimentation processes.&nbsp; Comparison of the g*(s) distributions from
different experiments at different loading concentrations can give some
information about the underlying processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sometimes, the g*(s) distribution is considered to be a 'model-free'
representation of the sedimentation data.&nbsp; It is very important to keep in
mind, however, that g*(s) is based on a specific model - that of non-diffusing
particles.&nbsp; In fact, this model is in most cases very poor.&nbsp; If we
compare it with the <a href="sedfit_help_cs.htm">c(s) distribution</a>, where we
use the model that all molecules have the same weight-average frictional ratio,
g*(s) would be equivalent with the assumption of all species having an infinite frictional
ratio (and in fact, the results of c(s) with f/f0 = 10 and ls-g*(s) are very
similar).&nbsp; This is not very realistic, and this is the reason for the much
lower resolution of g*(s) as compared to c(s).&nbsp; However, in some cases the
sedimentation process is very complex (e.g. non-ideal concentration dependent
sedimentation or complex heterogeneous chemical reactions), and currently,
diffusion can not be taken into account properly.&nbsp; This is where the model
of non-diffusing particles and g*(s) is highly useful.&nbsp; Obviously, it is
also the appropriate model if diffusion can be neglected (such as for very large
particles). </p>
<p>Note the new feature introduced in version 8.7 of S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit
</span>which allows to use the framework of the ls-g*(s) to generate a <a href="sedfit_help_size_distribution_options.htm#back-transform g(s*) to boundary model">back-transform
of the g(s*) distribution </a>[from dc/dt] into the original data space.&nbsp;
This eliminates the drawback of the g(s*) by dc/dt transform of not providing
any control over how well the original data are represented.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<img border="0" src="images/size-d12.gif" width="295" height="66"></p>
<p>Bridgman has shown how to calculate g*(s) from the radial derivative dc/dr (<a href="#ref 2">ref
2</a>), and Stafford has described the calculation of g*(s) from the
time-derivative dc/dt (<a href="#ref 3.">ref 3</a>).&nbsp; S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>
uses a different approach - the direct solution of the integral equation (Eq. 1)
(<a href="#ref number 1">ref 1</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be done by discretization of Eq. 1, very similar to the approach
described in the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#The implementation in Sedfit">introduction
to the size-distribution analysis</a>.&nbsp; We approximate Eq. 1 by&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<img border="0" src="images/lsgofs2.gif" width="193" height="66"></p>
<p>which can be solved as a least-squares problem:</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<img border="0" src="images/lsgofs3.gif" width="284" height="75"></p>
<p>(where the summation over r and t is over all experimental data points).&nbsp;
The coefficients <i>g*<sub>i</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>) </i>represent a discretized
approximation of the size-distribution g*(s).&nbsp; As shown in the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#The implementation in Sedfit">general
case</a>, we can introduce additional terms for the description of the <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">systematic
noise</a>, including the time-invariant noise as well as jitter and integral
fringe shifts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One technical difficulty in the discretization of the integral equation Eq. 1
is the choice of the grid of s-values <i>s<sub>i</sub></i>.&nbsp; As described
in the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#An example from the calculation of apparent sedimentation coefficient distributions ls-g*(s)">introduction
to regularization</a>, too fine discretization can lead to high artificial
oscillations, while too coarse discretization may not provide sufficient
detail.&nbsp; Therefore, regularization is used, and a penalty term for
oscillations is added to the minimization problem:</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<img border="0" src="images/lsgofs5.gif" width="505" height="78"></p>
<p>The second term serves to stabilize the solution by Tikhonov-Phillips
regularization, and like the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#Maximum entropy regularization">maximum
entropy regularization</a>, it is adjusted to give the most parsimonious
solution within a predefined confidence limit (see the <a href="sizedistributions.htm">introduction
to size-distributions</a>, <a href="sizedistributions.htm#The principle of regularization">regularization</a>,
and the paragraph on <a href="sizedistributions.htm#The difference between smoothing and regularization">the
difference between regularization and smoothing</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The important property of Eqs. 4 and 5 is that they are <b>linear</b>.&nbsp;
Therefore, we can easily calculate the distribution <i>g*<sub>i</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>)</i>,
as there exists a unambiguous minimum that can be calculated directly by
well-known algebraic methods.&nbsp; Because of the 1:1-relationship between the
data and the <i>g*<sub>i</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>)</i> distribution, this can be
considered a 'data transformation'. Similar to the other size-distributions, Eq.
5 is solved by normal equations, using Cholesky decomposition and a variant of
the dual-vector method NNLS by Lawson and Hanson for excluding negative values
for <i>g*<sub>i </sub></i>(more information can be found <a href="sizedistributions.htm#The implementation in Sedfit">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analysis in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> requires
some user input about the discretization, i.e. <a href="sizedistributions.htm#parameter resolution">resolution</a>,

<p><u><b><a name="Illustration of the principle">Illustration of the principle</a></b></u> </p>
<p>The meaning of the definition of ls-g*(s) in Eq. 1 and the discretization Eq.
3 can be visualized in the following way:&nbsp; The sedimentation profiles
U(s,r,t) are series of step-functions, describing the evolution of an infinitely
sharp boundary with radial dilution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/lsgofs6.gif" width="246" height="129"></p>
<p>The different U(s<sub>i</sub>,r,t) describe families of such step-functions with different sedimentation rate s<sub>i</sub>.&nbsp; In
essence, calculating g*(s) according to Eq. 3 is asking the question of what superposition of
step-functions can be found that describes the data c(r,t) best.&nbsp; This is
illustrated here:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/size-d13.gif" width="538" height="319"></p>
<p>In gray are sedimentation profiles c(r,t) (here simulated sedimentation
profiles of a single species with added noise), and in blue is
shown the best-fit discretization into step-functions.&nbsp; It is obvious that
we need smaller steps with lower sedimentation rate (green), larger steps with
intermediate sedimentation rate (red), and small steps again with high
sedimentation rate (black), in order to describe the data well.&nbsp; The magnitude of the steps
plotted as a function of the sedimentation rate&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/size-d14.gif" width="486" height="288"></p>
<p> is identical to the apparent
sedimentation coefficient distribution ls-g*(s).</p>

<p><u><b><a name="Equivalence of ls-g*(s) and g(s*)">Equivalence of ls-g*(s) and

<p>The distribution ls-g*(s) is equivalent to the distribution g(s*) derived
from dcdt, because both distributions are based on an equivalent definition of
g*(s) as the distribution of non-diffusing particles.&nbsp; If we apply both
methods to the same data set</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/lsgofs7.gif" width="364" height="347"></p>
<p>we get essentially the same results from dcdt (dashed blue, with confidence
bands in gray) and ls-g*(s) (red):</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/lsgofs8.gif" width="444" height="420"></p>
<p><font color="#008000">New:&nbsp; We also can take the results from dcdt,
build up a boundary model with step-functions as in ls-g*(s), determine the
best-fit TI noise, and compare this with the original data - this represents a <a href="sedfit_help_size_distribution_options.htm#back-transform g(s*) to boundary model">back-transform

<p>For the same sedimentation data shown above, ls-g*(s) allows to incorporate a
much larger time-interval without compromising the resolution: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/lsgofs11.gif" width="306" height="411"> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">NOTE:&nbsp; The time-interval should not be so large

<font color="#0000FF"><a href="#On boundary shape analysis">
<font color="#FF0000">boundary shape analysis</font></a></font><font color="#FF0000"> 
and when interpreting details of the distribution.&nbsp; For example, for 
moderately-sized proteins &lt; 100 kDa, this usually leads to a time-interval 
approximately 2 - 3 fold that recommended in DCDT+.&nbsp; However, this is 
purely dependent on the extent of diffusion, which means that a larger rotor 
speed can increase the permissible range of boundary displacement.&nbsp; Also, 
the permissible time-interval increases with larger species.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example is from the analysis of a dispersion: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/lsgofs12.gif" width="296" height="426"> </p>
<p>Here, the model of no diffusion is a very good approximation, and we get a
good fit.&nbsp; The size-distribution is very broad.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is
well-defined and does not suffer from a dependence on the choice of the data
subset.&nbsp; More information about this example, and the comparison with the
results from dcdt are given in <a href="#ref number 1">ref 1</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The following shows large boundary displacement as it might occur in an
absorbance experiment with two species with 31 and 35 S, at 50,000 rpm (top) and
30,000 rpm (middle).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/lsgofs13.gif" width="546" height="632"> </p>
<p>The fit of the 50,000 rpm data by ls-g*(s) (magenta) gives two well-separated
peaks.&nbsp; However, because of the large boundary displacement, we cannot analyze
the 50,000 rpm data with dcdt.&nbsp; This is possible if we run the same
experiment at a lower speed and take a data subset (blue circles).&nbsp; This
gives a g(s*) from dcdt as shown in the lower figure as blue dotted line, which
is essentially identical with the results of ls-g*(s) of the same data, or the
complete data shown at this speed.&nbsp; However, it is clear that the ability
to run species at higher speeds does produce much better separation, and as a
consequence, resolution in ls-g*(s). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="On boundary shape analysis">On boundary shape analysis in g*(s)</a></b></p>
<p>Historically, the quantitative analysis of g*(s) profiles by Gaussian fitting 
has been used to determine the diffusion coefficient D and therefore the molar 
mass M of a species.&nbsp; This approach is outdated, because it is based on 
relatively simple analytical approximation of the Lamm equation, where now more 
precise solutions are available.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The optimal procedure within the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit/</span>S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span> 
package for determining the molar mass of a species is the use of the
<a href="sedphat/hybrid_local_continuos_global_discrete.htm">hybrid 
discrete/continuous distribution in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edphat</span></a>, 
which models the species of interest with a discrete finite element Lamm 
equation solution, and allows for other species to be modeled by continuous 
segments.&nbsp; This is more precise than the molar mass values from the
<a href="sedfit_help_cm.htm">c(M) distribution</a>, because the latter is based 
on a weight-average f/f0, where the weight-average may be biased by other 
species in the sample.&nbsp; However, a c(s) or c(M) distribution is usually 
extremely helpful because it can take advantage of the data from the complete 
run and - due to the deconvolution of diffusion - reveal if there is 
heterogeneity <i>within</i> the diffusion-broadened boundary.&nbsp; Unrecognized 
heterogeneity would lead to artificially low molar mass estimates.</p>

<p>which means g*(s) is a Gaussian distribution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In summary, this shows that the definition of ls-g*(s) faithfully represents 
the radial derivative of the concentration distribution, which leads to a 
Gaussian distribution for a single diffusion species in the approximation of the
<a href="exampleFaxen.htm">Faxén solution of the Lamm equation</a>.</p>
<p><u>From theory to practice:</u>&nbsp; The preceding derivation was for a 
single point in time, i.e. for a single scan.&nbsp; Although one could in 
principle calculate such a ls-g*(s) distribution from a single scan, this is not 
implemented in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>, as it would 
not allow to distinguish systematic signal offsets from the interference 
offsets, and exhibit poor signal-to-noise characteristics.</p>
<p>For more than one scan, the resulting g*(s) distribution represents something 
like an average of Gaussians for the individual scans, which one can expect to 
lead to deformations of the Gaussian, and the problem of determining the correct 
time-point for evaluating the diffusion constant in Eq. 13.&nbsp; As a 'naive' 
assumption, which I would favor, one could take the average time-point of the 
scans considered, but it has not been shown that this is indeed correct.&nbsp; 
(This problematics exists in similar form also for the DCDT approach, which also 
relies on at least two scans taken at different points in time, but the point of 
averaging appears in a different space.)&nbsp; Although it follows that any 
deviation from a single scan or infinitesimal time-range is problematic, it 
should be noted that even then there are errors resulting from the underlying
<a href="exampleFaxen.htm">Faxén approximation of the Lamm equation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>A handle to this problem can be obtained from considering the quality of fit 
of the ls-g*(s) model to the raw data.&nbsp; If the residuals are random within 
the noise of the signal, it could be argued that the time-points of any of the 
scans is just as good as another.&nbsp; Although the particular choice would 
lead to different D values, this should be understood as a translation of the 
noise in the signal into the range of D values.&nbsp; The requirement for a good 
fit excludes large time-intervals for data where the diffusional fluxes are high 
(in particular, for small molecules and low rotor speeds).&nbsp; If, on the 
other hand, diffusional fluxes are small and a correspondingly larger 
time-interval can be chosen without compromising the quality of the fit 
(translating to a larger relative range of D-values), this would satisfy our 
expectation that in experiments with high s and low D the diffusion constant is 
not very well determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#0033CC">For boundary shape analysis by secondary modeling of ls-g*(s), 
therefore, it is essential that the fit is of good quality.&nbsp; This is just a 
reflection of the fact that if the fit of a model is not good, not a lot of 
trust can be placed in the details of the parameters obtained.&nbsp; For small 
species and low rotor speeds (i.e. at high diffusional fluxes) this requires 
smaller time-intervals than larger species or higher rotor speeds. </font> </p>
<p><font color="#0033CC">As outlined above, I would strongly recommend the use

<p>In brief, this model describes the sedimentation of a distribution of non-diffusing
species.&nbsp; It is closely related to the results of g(s*) by dcdt, but in the
form of a direct boundary model.&nbsp; When applied to a data set where the dcdt
method is applicable (i.e. a not too much boundary displacement and a limited
number of scans), ls-g*(s) and g(s*) by dcdt give the same results.&nbsp;
However, ls-g*(s) has several advantages that make it more versatile:</p>
<p>1) As a direct boundary model, there is no differentiation step and no
approximation of dc/dt by <font face="Symbol">D</font>c/<font face="Symbol">D</font>t.
As a consequence, we <b>do not need to take data from small time-intervals</b>
only.&nbsp; There is <b> no artificial broadening caused by having too many
scans</b>! (A mathematical analysis of the broadening that occurs due to the
approximation of dc/dt by <font face="Symbol">D</font>c/<font face="Symbol">D</font>t
is included as an appendix to <a href="#ref number 1">ref 1</a>.)&nbsp;
<font color="#0033CC">Limitations are imposed by the requirement to have a good 
fit of the data.</font>&nbsp; </p>
<p>2) Ability to work with scans that have large displacement is highly useful
when analyzing <b>absorbance data</b>, but the method works <b>equally well for
interference data</b>, where <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">systematic
noise decomposition</a> is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Because large boundary displacement is not an issue, experiments can
be run at <b>higher rotor speeds</b>, which can translate to <b>higher
resolution</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) It is suitable for <b>combination with non-linear regression</b>, for
example for determining the exact meniscus position.</p>
<p>The practical use of the method is described as a <a href="tutorial_lsgofs.htm">chapter</a>
of the step-by-step <a href="tutorial_sizedistributions.htm">tutorial on </a> <a href="tutorial_sizedistributions.htm">size distributions</a>,
and can also be seen in the <a href="sedfit_example.htm">example of using S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working with interference optical data (or other data requiring
time-invariant noise analysis), the method works best with large data sets, and
with data where the boundary has cleared the meniscus.&nbsp; This minimizes a
fundamental problem of correlation of small s-values of the distribution with
the degrees of freedom from the unknown <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm#Limitation">time-invariant
noise</a>.</p>
