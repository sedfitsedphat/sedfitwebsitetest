<p><u><b><a name="Summary and Conclusions">Summary and Conclusions</a></b></u></p>
<p>In this example, we have followed the main steps of a c(s) analysis.&nbsp;
These are:</p>
<p>1) Loading the data and getting an overview of the s-range with a coarse
distribution (low resolution)</p>
<p>2) Refine the analysis by adjusting the s-range, and by using a higher
resolution.&nbsp; Combine with critical inspection of the fit (e.g. using the
residuals bitmap to assess systematics in the residuals)</p>
<p>3) Nonlinear regression of the frictional ratio parameter and the meniscus
location (if necessary, slightly reduce the number of scans, and switch off the
regularization for this step only) </p>
<p>4) Increase the resolution to final value (reload all data, and switch on the
regularization again), possibly fine-adjustment of s-range. Verify that a good
fit was achieved.&nbsp; One should generally be cautious to use a wide enough
s-range, and not interpret peaks close to the extreme values of the
distribution.</p>
<p>5) Save and export the c(s) data for plotting, storage, and further analysis.</p>
<p>In most cases, this allows to achieve a high resolution with
baseline-resolved oligomers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the BSA, in the c(s) analysis we found the presence of a fraction (~1%) of small
species (probably from proteolytic degradation), as well as 11-12% of dimeric
BSA, 2-3% of BSA trimer, and probably a total of 0.8% of larger oligomers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Sharper peaks can be obtained using the Bayesian assumption that all species 
are pure, as shown above)</p>
<p>As will be shown in the <a href="tutorial_cofm.htm">following chapter</a>,
conversion to a molar mass distribution c(M) gives good estimates for the
oligomer molar masses (this may not be true in general for oligomerizing 
systems, see the <a href="sedfit_help_cm.htm#Note">note about c(M)</a>; the
<a href="sedphat/hybrid_local_continuos_global_discrete.htm">SEDPHAT hybrid 
discrete/continuous</a> model is the most correct and powerful way to analyze 
such a case):</p>

<p>The following chapter illustrates how the calculate a two-dimensional 
size-and-shape distribution c(s,M), which is free of the scale-relationship 
assumptions:</p>

<p>Finally, as a comparison with a g*(s) analysis, the final chapter of the
tutorial will treat the ls-g*(s) analysis, which will result in the following
distribution:</p>

<p>This is not recommended, but interesting in comparison with older methods of 
sedimentation analysis.</p>
