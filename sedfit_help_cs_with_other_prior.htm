However, there are some differences in the prior knowledge.&nbsp; While the

<p>The conformational change model allows to incorporate <b>additional prior knowledge on
one species with a known molar mass</b>.&nbsp; This model is useful simply if
one knows the molar mass of the main species.&nbsp; Because this species may undergo a conformational change, and
therefore sediment with different s-values under different conditions, this
model is suitable for such species with conformational change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, this model assumes a constant molar mass for
all species sedimenting in a specified range of s-values.&nbsp; Outside this range, a
constant weight-average frictional ratio is assumed just like in the 'normal'
c(s).&nbsp; The advantage of this model is an enhanced precision in
the distribution analysis by making use of the known molar mass value, which
allows to calculate a precise diffusion coefficient via the Svedberg equation
for each s-value within the pre-defined range.</p>
<p>The parameters for this model look very much the same as in the normal c(s),
except for the additional field in the top left corner, which contains the
information on the single species with known molar mass:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit46.gif" width="659" height="300"></p>
<p>The Mw field is for the molar mass (in Dalton, with buoyancy factor as
specified in the v-bar and buffer density setting).&nbsp; The s-min and s-max
directly under the Mw field determine the sedimentation coefficient range for
which the molar mass value should be used.&nbsp; The meaning of all the other
fields is exactly the same as in the normal <a href="sedfit_help_cs.htm">c(s)
model with constant frictional ratio</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, it is probably necessary to run a normal c(s) first, in order to
determine the s-range of the peak for the main species (or the one with the
known molar mass, respectively).&nbsp; After that, this conformational change
model can be used to produce a refined analysis.</p>

<p>The c(s) with constant D model is very similar to the normal c(s) model, but
instead of using the approximation of similar shape (constant frictional ratio)
for all molecules in the distribution, it uses the approximation of a constant
diffusion coefficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p> This could be the approximately the case for narrow distributions, e.g.
after fractionation by size-exclusion chromatography,
or for molecules like ferritin, where the hydrodynamic radius of the molecules
is constant throughout the distribution.&nbsp; An average D could be known from dynamic
light scattering experiments, or the weight-average D can also be fitted to the data.</p>
<p>The parameter box looks very much like the one from c(s) analysis, but with
two differences:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit47.gif" width="443" height="299"></p>
<p>First, instead of the frictional ratio field we have now a field
&quot;D&quot; for entering the diffusion coefficient (in 10<sup>-7</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/sec).&nbsp;
As usual, if the check-box left to the D field is marked, this parameter will be
fitted in a non-linear regression if the Fit command is used.&nbsp; The second
difference is that the fields for the partial-specific volume, buffer density
and viscosity are disabled, because they are not needed (these parameters were
only used in the normal c(s) model to give us D from the combination of s and
the frictional ratio).</p>

</b>
</font><p>This special case of the c(s) distribution analysis makes use of the
knowledge of s and M for one particular molecule in solution.&nbsp; Imagine that
we acquire interference optical data, but have more sodium chloride in the
sample than in the reference solution. (Obviously, it would be better to do a
dialysis, but this may not always be possible.)&nbsp; Such data may look like
this:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit49.gif" width="523" height="164"></p>
<p>where clearly the sedimentation of a small component is superimposed to the
macromolecular sedimentation.&nbsp; This model allows to include one additional
discrete component that can take into account one such extra small molar mass
component.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The parameter box looks like the normal c(s) parameters, but with two extra
fields in the middle right:&nbsp; one for the sedimentation coefficient of the
small component, and one for the molar mass (this refers to an 'effective' molar
mass using the buoyancy as specified in the partial-specific volume and the
buffer density field).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit48.gif" width="440" height="295"></p>
<p>It is clear that allowing for the additional discrete small species will make
the c(s) distribution dependent on the s and M of that species.&nbsp; In some
situations, it may be possible to determine such an s and M value from
independent experiments.&nbsp; More likely, however, the s and M of the discrete
component has to be fitted by nonlinear regression (as usual, put a mark in the
check-box to the left of the parameter and use the Fit command).&nbsp; This can
be done similar to the optimization of the frictional ratio as shown in the <a href="tutorial_sizedistributions.htm">tutorial</a>,
and should include as additional parameters to be optimized the meniscus and the
bottom position of the solution column. </p>
<p>The resulting c(s) distribution of such a fit may look like this:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit50.gif" width="546" height="493"></p>
<p>Please note the very large value at the first s-value - this is a result of
the way the distribution is internally organized:&nbsp; <b>The first data point
of the c(s) distribution will be replaced by the discrete species.&nbsp; </b>Therefore,
export to a spreadsheet program (using the <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Data Tables">copy
command</a>, as described in the tutorial) is highly recommended for displaying
the result.&nbsp; There, the first data point should be removed (or
disregarded). </p>

separate f/f0 parameters.&nbsp; The structure of the input box is similar as
that for conformational change above:&nbsp; An area in the upper left corner
specifies the f/f0 value for a particular region of the c(s) distribution.&nbsp;

protein-detergent complex where the detergent micelle is large compared to the 
protein, and/or where the protein is known not to be highly extended.&nbsp; In 
such a case, the frictional ratio may be close to unity (or the value for the 
detergent micelle alone, respectively).&nbsp; As a consequence, from the 
experimentally observed ratio of sedimentation relative to diffusion, the 
buoyancy factor can be extracted, i.e. the density increment (partial specific 
volume) of the protein-detergent complex.&nbsp; </p>

</font><p>This model is for flexible macromolecules that can be described as 
wormlike chains of subunits, where the subunits have known molar mass ('monomer 
Mw (Da)'), a known cross-section ('dehydrated cross-section (nm^2'), and an

coefficient distributions of a mixture of long chains (much longer than 
monomer), which for a given molar mass distribution depends on the persistence 
length of the chains.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The persistence length can be either fixed or floated in the analysis.&nbsp; 
However, most likely for the envisioned application to long chains, the 
diffusion on the time-scale of sedimentation may be fairly small, such that the 
precision of the estimate of the persistence length from the fit may be 
relatively poor.&nbsp; </p>

</font><p>There are situations where we know a priori the relationship of the 
sedimentation coefficient as a function of molar mass.&nbsp; In this case, it is 
unnecessary and unproductive to make any assumptions.&nbsp; Instead, the known 
relationship can be used in SEDFIT.&nbsp; (Knowing s and M, obviously allows to 
calculate D, which will be used in the Lamm equation solution for the particular 
s-value.)</p>
<p>To do this, you need to create a file &quot;mofs.dat&quot; in the folder &quot;c:\sedfit&quot;. 
This file may be created, for example, with the notepad.&nbsp; It must contain 
two columns, where the first is the s-value (s20w in S), the second is the molar 
mass (kDa) that belongs to this s-value.&nbsp; It may look like this:</p>
<p>1 1<br>
2 5<br>
3 20<br>
4 50<br>
5 80<br>
6 100<br>
7 150<br>
8 180<br>
9 200<br>
10 250<br>
15 400<br>
20 800<br>
25 1500</p>
<p>Note, there's no need to have any specific spacing (except the s-values must 
be monotonically increasing).&nbsp; SEDFIT will use linear interpolation to 
derive Mw-values for intermediate s-values as appropriate.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit12.jpg" width="440" height="360"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important:&nbsp; The s-values are in s20w!&nbsp; SEDFIT will assume that the 
v-bar, buffer density and viscosity have been set properly in this box.&nbsp; 
The final output will be the usual experimental s-value scale.&nbsp; Only for 
using the lookup table, internally a conversion to s20w is made.&nbsp; But for 
consistency with the other models, the output is done in experimental s-values.</p>
