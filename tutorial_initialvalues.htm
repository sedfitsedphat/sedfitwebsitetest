<p><b><u><a name="Selecting the Model and Setting the Parameters">Selecting the
model and setting initial values for the parameters</a></u></b></p>
<p>Next, we select the analysis model and set the parameters. This will be done
in several steps, each time refining and optimizing the settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, click on the <a href="sedfit_help_cs.htm">continuous c(s) distribution
menu</a>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori5.gif" width="657" height="472"></p>
<p>Then click on the <a href="sedfit_help_parameters.htm">parameter</a> menu,</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori6.gif" width="657" height="473"></p>
<p>which will bring up the following parameter box with the default settings:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori27.jpg"></p>
<p>For a quick first overview, we should enter a value of 100 for the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#parameter resolution">resolution
parameter</a>.&nbsp; For BSA, I would set <a href="sizedistributions.htm#s-min">s-min</a>
to 1, and <a href="sizedistributions.htm#s-max">s-max</a> to 10, so that we can
see both smaller fragments (if there was some proteolytic activity), as well as
the oligomers which are well-known to occur with BSA.&nbsp; As a starting guess,
a frictional ratio of 1.2 does seem reasonable for a globular protein, but
BSA is somewhat asymmetric, therefore let's start with a guess of 1.4.&nbsp;
(This will turn out to be a bad starting guess, but these settings will be refined later.)&nbsp;&nbsp;When
interpreting the frictional ratio, please note that this is an anhydrous
frictional ratio, and that it is only a multiplicative factor together with the
solvent viscosity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could calculate the precise partial-specific volume of BSA, but the v-bar
and the buffer density and viscosity will be completely correlated with the
frictional ratio parameter (see the equations in the <a href="sedfit_help_cs.htm">help-page
of the c(s) model</a>) and will only influence slightly the estimate of
diffusion. (There will be no correction of s-values to s<sub>20</sub>
values.)&nbsp; Therefore, I suggest using an estimate of the v-bar of 0.73, and
for PBS a buffer density of 1.005, and a viscosity of 0.0102.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that by default all the baseline parameters are checked for
interference data.&nbsp; We do not need to change anything there.&nbsp; If we
were looking at absorbance data, in general the Baseline should be allowed to
float (checked), whereas the Fit RI Noise and the Fit Time Independent Noise
mostly would stay unchecked.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#800080" size="2">(Starting from version 8.5 and later, there's
the possibility in sedfit to control the spacing of the s-values in the
distribution, either logarithmically or arbitrary, but we use the default, which
is linear spacing.)</font></p>
<p>After all these entries, the parameter box should look like this:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori32.jpg"></p>
<p><font size="1">(The settings for Baseline, Fit RI noise and Fit Time
Independent Noise are redundant and sedfit may automatically switch off the
Baseline when RI and TI noise are used.)</font></p>
<p>If we execute the <a href="sedfit_help_run.htm">Run</a>  command (please
note: this is <b>not </b> the <a href="sedfit_help_fit.htm">Fit</a>  command,
which is reserved for non-linear regression)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori15.gif" width="654" height="472"></p>
<p>we will calculate the first c(s) distribution. During the calculation, we
will get the information&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="1"><b>allocating memory space...</b></font></p>
<p><font size="1"><b>solving Lamm equation for ... </b></font>(with progress
indicator)</p>
<p><font size="1"><b>calculating normal equations ... </b></font>(with progress
indicator)</p>
<p><font size="1"><b>regularization ... </b></font>(with progress indicator)</p>
<p>During the last three steps, pressing the space bar on the keyboard will
interrupt the calculations. This particular calculation is complete after ~ 1
min on a 700 MHz Pentium III laptop. In general, it will take longer for
larger resolution, and with more scans, and it will be faster with absorbance
data (and obviously it will be faster with a faster computer...).</p>
<p>As output, fitted curves will be drawn into the data scans, the residuals are
shown in a smaller plot in the middle, and a new lower plot appears showing the
c(s) distribution (which at this stage is still very coarse).&nbsp; Also, some
information will be written to the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> 
 window, which will be explained in the next paragraph.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori9.gif" width="620" height="475"></p>
<p>At this stage of the analysis, the most important information written to the
screen is the rmsd value of 0.0074 given in the second row.&nbsp; (If the screen
redraws, the text information disappears, but it can be retrieved by using the <a href="sedfit_help_display.htm#Show Last Fit Info Again">Display-&gt;Show
Last Fit Info Again</a> command).&nbsp; From the distribution, it can already be
seen that most of the material sediments with s-values between 4 and 5, and that
there is some larger oligomers present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the analysis at the current stage is the
distribution of residuals:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori21.gif" width="846" height="151"></p>
<p>Although this does not look great, yet, the absence of very large residuals
at the extreme radius values indicates that the fitting limits (green lines) are
OK and not too close to meniscus and bottom.&nbsp; A typical picture of residuals
when the outer fitting limit is too close to the bottom would look like this</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori23.gif" width="844" height="149"></p>
<p>Note that the scale of the residuals plot is dominated by very large
residuals at the right end of the plot.&nbsp; In such a case, one needs to set
the outer fitting limit (green line in vicinity of the bottom) to smaller radius
values.&nbsp; Analogously, if the residuals are dominated by very large
deviations close to the meniscus, one would see this here in the left side of
the residuals plot, and would need to place the inner fitting limit (green line
in vicinity of the meniscus) to larger radius values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to our analysis.&nbsp; Although the rmsd of 0.0074 seems quite good, the fit is really poor
and needs to be refined before we can interpret the distribution.&nbsp; Without
making sure that we have a good fit, artifacts can occur in the c(s)
distribution (in our analysis, for example the artificial sharp peak at 7.8 S).</p>
<p>To achieve a better inspection, we can subtract the calculated
systematic noise from the data with the following command (or by using the
keyboard shortcut ctrl-N).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori10.gif" width="651" height="473"></p>
<p>A message box will appear</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori11.gif" width="550" height="125"></p>
<p>that is just a reminder that we are about to modify the original data.&nbsp;
As explained in the <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">introduction to the
systematic noise</a>, this does not introduce any bias, as long as we keep in
all the following analyses the degrees of freedom of the systematic noise, which
means one should not modify the RI Noise and TI Noise in the parameter input
boxes (leave them checked).&nbsp; As a result, we get a clear picture of the
sedimentation process:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori12.gif" width="652" height="473"></p>
<p>Although this fit looks already promising, it is still very coarse and must
be refined in order to allow a meaningful interpretation.&nbsp;</p>
