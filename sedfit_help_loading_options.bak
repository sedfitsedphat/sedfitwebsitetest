<p>This is a new function in version 9.2 and higher.&nbsp; It allows to 
pre-average neighboring data points within a scan, in order to speed up a 
preliminary data analysis.&nbsp; This function is controlled by specifying the 
(average) radial increment of data points that are desired.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>If a value of 0.001 or less is entered, all data points are loaded and 
pre-averaging is switched off.&nbsp; </b>Higher values will switch pre-averaging 
on.&nbsp; Pre-averaging will reduce slightly the noise of the data, but 
obviously limit the radial precision.&nbsp; Statistically, there is no advantage 
of pre-averaging, only a slight (and sometimes perhaps negligible) loss of 
precision.&nbsp; However, this comes with a potentially large gain in 
computational time.&nbsp; I suggest that this may be useful for routine-analyses 
and preliminary analyses aimed at surveying reasonable fitting parameters, but 
should be switched off for the final fit.</p>
<p>For example, with values of 0.002, the typical number of data points within 
an interference optical scan is reduced approximately by a factor 3.&nbsp; This 
can speed up processing in the c(s) distribution considerably, since the step of 
calculating the normal equations is dependent on the square of number of data 
points.</p>
<p>The radial resolution currently used is displayed in the first line of the 
fitting info text.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When changing this setting, you have the option to save the new value as a 
default parameter.&nbsp; If you do that, each time new data is loaded, this 
setting will be used.&nbsp; You can switch this off by changing the setting back 
to 0.001 and setting this as the default.</p>
<p>When the currently used value is changed, SEDFIT will offer to reload the 
data and re-execute the currently used analysis model.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Interference data sometimes have integral fringe offsets, which are artifacts

of the <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm">algebraic systematic noise

<p>This menu function allows to align all the
data at one specific radial point. The alignment algorithm will add new integral
offsets to all scans such that at the specifically selected radial point, they
all have a fringe value that is as close as possible to the fringe value of scan
#1. Therefore, a good selection of the radial point is a region in the plateau,
where little change occurs during the observed sedimentation process.</p>
<p>A potential problem might occur if no point can be found within the solution
column that does not change less than 0.5 fringes during the time observed.

<p>As an additional tool for examining experimental data, there is the option to
subtract simulated theoretical sedimentation profiles from the experimental
data.&nbsp; The way this works is that the current model functions (i.e. the
solid lines shown in the sedfit window as a result of executing any
sedimentation model) are simply subtracted from the data.&nbsp; For example, one
could just run a simulation for a sedimenting species at a given concentration
(NOT CHECK the fit concentration field, or any of the baseline or systematic
noise fields), and execute the 'Add or Subtract' function after that.&nbsp; This
allows playing with the data and generating &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios.&nbsp;
[For example, this function was used to simulate the sedimentation of mixtures
of self-associating and non-interacting species.]&nbsp; However, it is obviously
not something that should be done with any real data analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a simulation tool, it can be convenient to reload the previously fitted

strategy for reanalyzing data.&nbsp; (It can be used like an iteration of a <a href="sedfit_help_monte_carlo_simulations.htm">Monte-Carlo
simulation</a>, but that would be tedious. It's more useful to generate
simulated sedimentation profiles from scratch, using existing data as a
rotor-speed and time-interval template.)</p>
<p>Similarly, it can be useful sometimes to multiply the scans.&nbsp; For 
example, although this is normally not necessary, when using 3 mm cells, the 
data can be converted back to the same relationship between concentration and 
signal as the 12 mm cells by multiplication by 4.</p>

<p>It can be advantageous for the determination of the bottom position or
the buffer background absorbance, data can be collected as ‘intensity’
files with the XLA data acquisition software.&nbsp; These data files can be loaded and
analyzed with S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> directly. However, for compatibility of
these data files with other software, or for improved visual representation, with this function
they can be saved as ordinary absorbance files. The file extensions
will be automatically changed from ‘*.ri*’ to ‘*.ra*’. These files will
have the reference intensities in the third column.</p>

<p>For sedimentation velocity studies, it is possible to generate fill both
reference and sample sector with sample. When scanned as intensity data, this
function allows to generate two separate absorbance data sets, one for each
channel. Of course, since there is no reference transmission recorded (this is
simply set to the default of 1000), the data are not true absorbance data, hence
the name ‘pseudo-absorbance’.</p>
<p>Such data have <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm"> systematic noise components</a> that are similar in structure to
the systematic noise components of the interference optics. Therefore, they can
be analyzed using <a href="systematic_noise_analysis.htm"> algebraic RI and TI noise
decomposition</a>. There will be small
correlation of the additional noise and baseline parameters with species of
small sedimentation coefficient. For larger particles, however, this is not the
case. Therefore, this method can effectively double the capacity of a AUC run
for velocity experiments. This method is described in:</p>

<p>This menu function allows to save the data set that is being fitted. This can
be useful, for example, after elimination of spikes, or after alignment of
integral interference offset, in order to facilitate data analysis using other
software. Also, equilibrium data can be loaded, and saved using this option to
eliminate their spikes.</p>
<p>The filename specified in the file input dialog box is appended by the
original filename and extension.</p>
<p><i><b><font color="#FF00FF">New in version 8.7:&nbsp; </font></b>There is the
option to rename the files to extend the filename to include the wavelength and
the rotor speed, e.g. &quot;20k280_001.ra2&quot; instead of
&quot;00001.ra2&quot;.&nbsp; This can be very convenient when sorting
sedimentation equilibrium files that were generated using the equilibrium method
of the Beckman XLA/I operating software.</i></p>
<p>When the raw data are saved in three subsets, the current directory is used,
and the first character of the filename will be changed to &quot;i&quot; for
inner sector, &quot;m&quot; for middle sector, or &quot;o&quot; for outer
sector, respectively. The radii where to cut the data are asked from the user,
suggesting 6.2 and 6.7, which are just in the middle between the sectors for the
six-channel centerpieces. Further, a integer will be added or subtracted to the
scans such that the signal in between the cut radii (i.e. 6.0, 6.45 and 6.95)
will be as close to zero as possible. This function therefore should be
convenient to simplify subsequent data processing in equilibrium analyses, but
separating the different subsets, and eliminating some estimated integral fringe
shift.</p>

<p>This function will allow testing for attainment of sedimentation equilibrium 
in real-time or after all scans have been collected.&nbsp; It creates three 
graphs:&nbsp; 1) the rmsd of all scans relative to the last scan (as introduced 
first in WINMATCH): this curve should asymptotically level off at a value that 
is close to the noise of data acquisition.&nbsp; 2) an inset showing the last 
scan which serves as a reference: this is good to see to make sure there are no 
regions of optical artifacts included in the comparison. 3) a plot of the radial 
profile of the difference between the last two scans. This is a different way to 
assess whether the solution is in sedimentation equilibrium, because the 
difference should be random and close to the noise of data acquisition.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit21.jpg"></p>
<p>This can be done for multiple cells at once, all data types, different 
wavelengths side-by-side (just not mixed interference and absorbance/intensity 
data).&nbsp; Also, this allows for scans to be loaded the cover scan series at 
different rotor speeds.&nbsp; The data from the highest rotor speed (usually the 
most recent series) is indicated by the circles.</p>
<p>When using this function, one must pay attention to properly choose the 
regions of scans without optical artifacts.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>This function is solving the following problem: A sedimentation equilibrium 
experiment can be conducted using the &quot;Equilibrium Method&quot; in the XLA/I 
software.&nbsp; This allows to specify time-points and rotor speeds for a series 
of scans.&nbsp; The XLA/I software saves all scans taken with this method in one 
directory, and all scans from different rotor speeds, wavelengths, temperatures, 
are all saved with an incrementally increasing filenames 00001.ra1, etc.&nbsp; 
For the sedimentation equilibrium analysis, we need to specify which of these 
scans was the last one taken with a particular wavelength at a particular rotor 
speed.&nbsp; This can be very tedious.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>The function &quot;sort eq. data&quot; simplifies this task, by performing the 
appropriate file selection, data transformation (if necessary from intensity to 
absorbance), blank subtraction (if necessary for interference scans), copying 
and renaming the files (to display rotor speed and wavelength in the filename) 
and assembly into xp-files ready for SEDPHAT equilibrium analysis.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>An example of its use can be found in the tutorial of
<a href="sedphat/DNATutorial_2.htm#Loading and sorting data in SEDFIT">
sedimentation equilibrium analysis with SEDPHAT</a>. This will clarify the steps 
involved.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Points to consider:</p>
<p>* do not load data from different optical systems at once.</p>
<p>* if dealing with 6-channel cells, use the function &quot;<a href="#Save Raw Data In 3 Subsets">Save 
6-channel Raw Data In 3 Subsets</a>&quot; prior to this function.</p>
<p>* SEDFIT will consider scans to be at the same wavelengths, if the wavelength 
entry is less than 5 nm apart (this takes into account the error in the 
monochromator wavelength control)</p>
<p>* when acquiring intensity data, you can load them all at once, and they will 
automatically be transformed to absorbance data.&nbsp; The inspection of the 
intensity data can be very useful in order to assess the fitting limits.&nbsp; 
This is true, in particular, if you look at the data cell by cell.&nbsp; <b>
Fitting limits and meniscus and bottom specified after loading the data will be 
maintained in the xp-files</b>, and this is a convenient time to do this (you 
may need to constrain fitting limits further later, but at least you can 
determine limits for the maximal data sets).</p>
<p>* you can load data from all different cells at once, but not if you need to 
subtract blanks.&nbsp; You will only have the chance to specify a single blank, 
therefore if you have interference data and want to subtract blank scans, do the 
cells one by one.</p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF"><b>New in version 9.2:&nbsp; </b></font>It is possible

distinct horizontal line is visible in this bitmap, it may be a result of a bad 
scan, for example, from an odd vibration of the camera.&nbsp; Likewise, when 
dealing with systems with large refractive index signals, it is possible that 
for selected scans the fringe tracking algorithm fails.&nbsp; This may be 
repaired with the function
<a href="#Elimination of fringe jumps within each scan">'eliminate fringe jumps

cases, may be justified to simply exclude this scan from consideration.&nbsp; </p>

to search for the largest local rms deviation in the file 'scanrms.dat'.&nbsp;

<p>This assumes intensity autocorrelation data from homodyne configuration
(referred to as 'self-beating' in BIC instruments).</p>
<p>When working with Protein Solutions 99 Dynamics version 5.20.05, first, several raw autocorrelation data sets from Protein Solutions 99 should be
exported in the DynaPro software with the options: analysis results,
autocorrelation coefficients, all measurements, ASCII text, include headers.
Then, with the ‘Make DLS Data’ function, they can be loaded into S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>.
This allows selection of good measurements, and to avoid bad ones.</p>
<p>The data can then be averaged and saved in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> DLS format with the
function ‘save mean DLS data...’. They can then be analyzed in terms of
single species analysis with M and s (instead of D), or in terms of
size-distribution analysis (Rh-distribution or D-distribution).</p>
<p>With the Protein Solution Dynamics version 5.26.38, the format is slightly
different.&nbsp; Export the experimental data as &quot;this experiment
only&quot;, with the options 'parameter settings', 'autocorrelation
coefficients', and 'cumulants datalog'.&nbsp; The options are to load the entire
time course as different files, or to load only the average data.&nbsp; Note
that in version 5.26.38, marked measurements are excluded from the exported data
and from the averaging.</p>
<p>For the Brookhaven data, the *.dat file is read and directly saved as *.dlsdat
file. In the process, the counts per channel are divided by the measured
baseline entry of the BIC data to generate the normalized autocorrelation
function.&nbsp; Two different BIC ASCII data formats can be read, that of the
9kdlsw32.exe ver. 3.19 (we bought it in 2000, running under Windows), and data
from an older DOS version (this has only 13 entries before the two-column time-vs-counts
data).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the ALV data files, they need to be generated by the ALV-5000/E.V.
2.0.6.2, saved as ALV-5000 Data ASCII.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The 2 column ASCII option allows to use a simple file with the 
autocorrelation data as pairs of correlation time and count rate (tab or space 
delimited).&nbsp; All other information will be entered separately.</p>
<p>The 2 column ASCII g(2)-1 is a function that was written for Malvern 
Zetasizer NanoS.&nbsp; You can use the <a href="images/MakeDLSDAT_v1_0.zmac">Zetasizer export macro</a> writen by Ulf Nobbmann
