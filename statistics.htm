<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three major tools for error analysis:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) F-statistics</p>
<p>2) covariance matrix</p>
<p>3) Monte-Carlo analysis</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In practice, the most reliable approach for error analysis is the projections 
of the error surface method.&nbsp; Although the absolute value of chi-square (‘global 
red. chi-square’ in the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT </span>
window display)&nbsp; should not be interpreted without absolute knowledge on 
the noise in the data, the relative increase of chi-square comparing the 
original and the new fit is a statistical quantity that can be evaluated using 
the F-statistics.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, to determine the error limits on a binding constant, follow 
these steps: </p>
<p>0) Make sure you have the best fit. (Repeat the optimization a few times 
alternating the <a href="options.htm#Marquardt-Levenberg">Simplex and 
Marquardt-Levenberg</a> method.)&nbsp; Save the current configuration (usually 
with new xp files).</p>
<p>1) Calculate the critical value for chi-square (Statistics -&gt; Critical 
chi-square for error surface projections).&nbsp; </p>
<p>2) Set the value of the binding constant at a non-optimal value close to the 
best-fit parameter (for example, increase log(K<sub>A</sub>) by 0.1), and fix 
the binding constant.&nbsp; Keep all other unknown parameters floating just like 
in the previous fit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>3) Execute a new fit.&nbsp; If the original fit was the best fit, then 
current fit will have a higher chi-square value.&nbsp; Three things may happen:</p>
<p>3a) If a chi-square value smaller than the original best-fit value is 
observed, which can sometimes happens with complex error surfaces, you have just 
found a better fit! Go back to step 0.</p>
<p>3b) If the new value exceeds the critical value, then the modified binding 
constant is already outside of the error interval.&nbsp; Go back to step 2 and repeat 
with a smaller step (closer to the previous best-fit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>3c) If the new chi-square value is higher than the original best-fit value, 
but lower than the critical value, fix log(K<sub>A</sub>) at a value a bit 
further from the best-fit value and re-fit.&nbsp; Repeat Step 2/3 until the current 
chi-square value is exceeding the critical value, indicating that one of the 
limits of log(K<sub>A</sub>) error interval has been found.&nbsp; </p>
<p>4) Reload the best-fit configuration and repeat the procedure 2/3 by changing 
log(K<sub>A</sub>) in the other direction.</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366"> <a name="F-statistics"><b>F-statistics</b></a> &nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p> is explained in detail in
the <a href="../sedfit_help_fstatistics.htm" target="_blank"> S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT
</span>help section on F-statistics</a>.&nbsp; It is based on generating a
series of fits, constraining the parameter in question to non-optimal values
(starting close to the optimum and moving away), and observing at which point
the resulting fit (optimizing all other parameters) worsens the chi-square by a
certain critical factor.&nbsp; The implementation of this is straightforward in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span>.&nbsp;
The critical values of the reduced chi-square are calculated in the function &quot;<a name="Critical chi-square for error surface projections">Critical 
chi-square for error surface projections</a>&quot;.&nbsp; The approximation used is 
that both numbers of degrees of freedom are equal to the number of data points.&nbsp; 
This is a very good approximation for global fits with lots of data points.&nbsp; 
(A more exact value can be calculated using the <a href="../sedfit_help_calculator.htm#Calculate F-distribution">calculator
in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span></a> after counting the 
number of fitted parameters.) For details, see <i>Bevington: Data Reduction
in the Physical Sciences</i>.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366">The <a name="covariance matrix"><b>covariance matrix</b></a> &nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p> is based on the
local approximation of the error surface as a paraboloid, which permits for
linear models the exact prediction of error intervals.&nbsp; It is quite fast,
but because it is based on a linearized approximation of the error surface in
the minimum, it usually significantly underestimates the real errors associated
with the parmeters.&nbsp; (In the implementation in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span>,
it uses numerical differentiation like the <a href="fit.htm#Marquardt-Levenberg">Marquardt-Levenberg</a>
algorithm [Press et al.])</p>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">Note: Although the error estimates from the covariance
matrix are not always realistic, the covariance matrix is an excellent tool to
study parameter correlation, and to compare error estimates under different
configurations of floating parameters.&nbsp; </font><font color="#0000FF" size="2">For
example, in some cases the consideration of radial-dependent systematic noise
for multi-speed sedimentation equilibrium data can significantly increase the
uncertainty of the parameters.&nbsp; This will be reflected in the covariance
matrix calculated with and without the TI noise.&nbsp; If, after switching the
TI noise on, the covariance matrix does not change much, then the TI noise is
well-defined by the data and does not correlate with any of the model parameters
of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font color="#FF00FF">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>An example of the output of the covariance matrix looks like this:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/statis5.jpg" width="814" height="245"></p>
<p>In the first line, you find the chisquare of the fit.&nbsp; The second line
is the best-fit parameters (this is useful in order to figure out the sequence
of how the global and local parameters are listed). The third line is are the
normalized gradients of the error surface. Then comes the covariance
matrix.&nbsp; The most important numbers are in the second column and are given
in parenthesis:&nbsp; these are the error estimates associated with the
parameters on the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#003366">The <a name="Monte-Carlo analysis"><b>Monte-Carlo analysis</b></a> &nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p> is in
theory a very safe way to calculate errors:&nbsp; It is based on generating
hypothetical data sets based on the best-fit distributions but with a new set of
normally distributed noise (this is the way it's implemented in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span>).&nbsp;
Each set is analyzed, and from many hundred or thousand of iterations a
distribution of the parameters is calculated, which contain the uncertainties
for each parameter.&nbsp; (See also the <a href="../sedfit_help_monte_carlo_simulations.htm" target="_blank">Monte-Carlo
analysis for distributions in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span></a>).</p>
<p>In practice, the drawback of the Monte-Carlo method is that it may not be
easy to really optimize each generated data set.&nbsp; In particular with
complicated error surfaces that have flat minima, I have observed incorrect
optimization causing errors in the parameter distributions.&nbsp; I would
recommend the Monte-Carlo for cases when you can easily converge with the
Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm to the global best-fit.&nbsp; In complicated cases
of global fits where you need to switch back and forth from Marquardt-Levenberg
and Nelder-Mead to find the optimum fit, I would advise against the Monte-Carlo
analysis and recommend the F-statistics instead.&nbsp; (In F-statistics, you
have control at each stage to make sure you are really optimizing the
parameters.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For executing the Monte-Carlo analysis, you need to specify the number of
iterations (test things out with 100, first, and then go to 1000 or more), the
confidence level (default is 0.68), and the directory where to put the
intermediate results.&nbsp; If you already did part of the Monte-Carlo in the
identical configuration, you can add the new iterations to the previous
ones.&nbsp; You will see the progress for each iteration in the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span>
window. In the end, you will get output of the following form:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="menubilder/statis6.jpg" width="639" height="212"></p>
<p>Each row corresponds to one parameter.&nbsp; First is the parameter name,
then the average bi-directional error (averaged between plus and minus
direction), then the parameter interval comprising the central percentile (i.e.
central 68% of the data for 1 standard deviation), and, for comparison, the
simple standard deviation assuming that the parameter values are distributed
normally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a name="regularization"><b>regularization</b></a> menu is for continuous
distributions in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edPHaT</span>, which
are not yet released for the most part.&nbsp; You'll be able to switch here
between different regularization procedures (see <a href="../sedfit_help_size_distribution_options.htm#Regularization by maximum entropy principle" target="_blank">regularization
in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfiT</span></a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
