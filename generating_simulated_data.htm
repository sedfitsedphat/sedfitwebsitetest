<p><font size="5">Generating New Simulated Sedimentation Data</font></p>
<p>There are a number of different ways in SEDFIT to simulate the sedimentation 
process and save the result in a sequence of files with the XLA format.&nbsp; 
The first two take utilize the function <a href="sedfit_help_generate.htm">
Generate</a> that allows generate from scratch a series of simulated scans for 
specific models.&nbsp; The last uses existing data as a template with regard to 
rotor speed, data range, and time interval.&nbsp; For simulating data of 
interacting systems, you can use SEDFIT to generate a template from scratch, and 
then simulate the distributions in SEDPHAT.</p>

<p><b><a name="Simulating Discrete Species">Simulating Discrete Species</a></b></p>
<p>This is probably the quickest way to simulate sedimentation of a single 
species, or if you have a mixture of a few (&lt; 4) discrete species.&nbsp; For 
example, one can use this to predict the minimum time to reach equilibrium and 
the shape of the equilibrium profiles at a certain rotor speed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Make sure you select the Non-Interacting Discrete Species model.&nbsp; This 
works also with the <a href="inhomogeneous_solvent.htm">inhomogeneous solvent</a> 
options switched on (but you will need to familiarize yourself with these 
features first, and have the necessary parameters already set; I suggest to 
explore these options with existing data before attempting to simulate them).</p>
<p>It is best to set the parameters already to the values you want to simulate.&nbsp; 
Note that the first concentration is the<b> total</b>, the following are <b>
fractions. </b>For example, with the concentration entry in the first component 
being 1 and the second concentration entry 0.05, will make the total loading 
signal 1, the first species 0.95, and the second species 0.05 loading 
concentration.&nbsp; Be careful also to set meniscus and bottom to describe the 
proper solution column.</p>
<p>For studying the approach to equilibrium, I would suggest to request scans in 
a few h intervals, over a time period of a couple of days.&nbsp; That will help 
you to explore the shape of equilibrium, and by counting the number of scans to 
attain equilibrium, you can figure out the minimum time (e.g. assuming no 
chemical reaction) to attain equilibrium.</p>
<p>Another frequent application is the prediction of c(s) resolution and 
faithful recovery of quantities of trace components. In this case, simply 
simulate the distribution of discrete species (optionally with dynamic density 
gradients, if that model is selected), specifying the mixture of interest.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions for the <a href="sedfit_help_generate.htm">Generate</a> 
function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="Simulating Distributions">Simulating Distributions</a></b> </p>
<p>This is more complicated than the simulation of discrete species, and should 
be used only if either the number of species of interest exceeds 4, or if you 
are truly interested in continuous distributions.&nbsp; There are several steps. </p>
<p>1) Select the c(s) distribution model.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2) Use any existing data, load the data, set up the c(s) parameters as you 
wish your simulated distribution to look like, with regard to: s-min, smax, 
resolution, f/f0, vbar, viscosity, density), and fit a c(s) distribution (never 
mind if it is a good fit or not).&nbsp; Use the function Data-&gt; Save Continuous 
Distribution to save the c(s) distribution into a file.&nbsp; As a filename, use 
c:\temp\distrib.dat. This will be a template to modify.&nbsp; Note: You can 
generate such a file from scratch, using the notepad.&nbsp; But it cannot be an 
empty file.</p>
<p>3) Use the Windows Explorer to locate this file, open it with notepad, and 
edit. You will see a 2-column matrix, with the first column the s-values, and 
the second column the distribution values.&nbsp; You can delete as many lines as 
you like, or enter new ones.&nbsp; This will be your sedimentation coefficient 
distribution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>4) Use the <a href="sedfit_help_generate.htm">Generate</a> function.&nbsp; 
(Make sure the c(S) model is still switched on.)&nbsp; In the parameter box, use 
the desired settings for f/f0, vbar, viscosity, density.&nbsp; You can ignore 
the s-min, s-max, and f/f0 entries, since it'll take this from the file 
c:\temp\distrib.dat.&nbsp; </p>
<p>5) A question will appear if the distribution is normalized (a true 
differential sedimentation coefficient distribution, where the integral 
corresponds to concentrations), or not.&nbsp; If not, the second column of the 
distrib.dat file will be interpreted directly as loading concentration values.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; Even though you use the distrib.dat entries directly as loading 
concentrations, the distribution displayed after simulating will be a 
differential distribution, which will appear distorted.&nbsp; However, the data 
loaded and saved are perfectly fine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="Alternative Simulation using Existing Data as a Template">
Alternative Simulation using Existing Data as a Template</a></b></p>
<p>You can easily simulate sedimentation data for which you have already a 
template regarding time-intervals, rotor speed, and radial data range.&nbsp; 
Simply load these data as a template, select your model, and do a RUN.&nbsp; Be 
sure to switch of the baseline parameters and the concentration parameters.&nbsp; 
Obviously, the &quot;fitted&quot; traces may have nothing to do with the loaded data 
template.&nbsp; However, they describe the distribution from the model you've 
specified.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Use the function <a href="sedfit_help_datautilities.htm#Save Fits">Data-&gt;Save 
Fit Data</a> to store the simulated distributions on the harddisk in XLA format.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this approach is that it doesn't have flexibility with 
regard to the rotor speed and time-interval of scans.&nbsp; Also, the radial 
range of the saved data is the fitting range specified.&nbsp; Although you can 
make sure that the &quot;fitting range&quot; is as wide as the template data permit, it 
cannot exceed the radial range of the template.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="Simulating Interacting Systems">Simulating Interacting Systems</a></b></p>
<p>This is also a three-step process.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1) Use the Generate function with a discrete species model to generate a 
template with regard to rotor speed, time-interval of scans, and radial range.&nbsp; 
Save the data somewhere in a temporary directory.&nbsp; Export the to SEDPHAT, 
and launch SEDPHAT.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2) Within SEDPHAT, use the experiment parameter box to set the extinction 
coefficients, meniscus, bottom as desired, and switch off baseline parameters.&nbsp; 
Then select the interaction model, set the global parameters, set the loading 
concentrations, and do a <b>RUN</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>3) Use the function Data-&gt;Save Fit Data within SEDPHAT to save the fitted 
curves containing the simulated distributions to the harddisk. </p>
