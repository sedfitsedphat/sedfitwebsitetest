<p>This function allows several transformations of a previously calculated
sedimentation coefficient distribution (e.g. obtained from ls-g*(s)). These can
only be calculated in sequence:</p>
<p>1) s(app) into s(20)&nbsp; [this can be done separately with the
<a href="sedfit_help_calculator.htm#s20w from sxp">calculator function</a>]</p>
<p>2) c(s20) into a distribution of hydrodynamic radii c(R). (since s~r^2, a
correction factor of 2r will be inserted for transformation of the integral ds
into dr) [this transformation from Stokes radii to s-values can be done 
separately using a <a href="sedfit_help_calculator.htm#Rh(s)">calculator 
function</a>]</p>
<p>3) corrections for a radius-dependent signal contribution (such as caused by
Mie scattering).</p>
<p>For the correction of the signal, a file with the signal as a function of
hydrodynamic radius must be provided, expressed in a power-series</p>
<p>signal(r) = a0 + a1*r + a2*r^2 + a3*r^3 + ... (with r in units of nm)</p>
<p>The format of the file should be a simple list of coefficients:</p>
<p>a0</p>
<p>a1</p>
<p>a2</p>
<p>with as many lines (and numbers) as coefficients to be taken into account.
The distribution c(R) will be divided by this function signal(r), to give
relative concentrations as a function of Stokes-radius R.</p>

<p>The details of this technique are also outlined in the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#The principle of regularization">introduction
to size-distributions</a>.&nbsp; In brief, in contrast to maximum entropy, the Tikhonov-Phillips method implemented here
uses a second-derivative operator for regularization.</p>

<p>This represents a constrained fit, where the first term represents the
unconstrained fit with a distribution, e.g. <i>c(M)</i>, and the second term is
the second derivative constraint. The constraint is controlled by the parameter <font FACE="Symbol">a</font>,
which can be adjusted with the use of <a href="sedfit_help_calculator.htm#Calculate F-distribution">F-statistics</a>.&nbsp;
The use of this constraint allows one to select the smoothest distribution of
all distributions that lead to a fit that is statistically indistinguishable from the
unconstrained case. This strategy is frequently used to suppress noise in the
inversion of Fredholm integral equations, using <i>a priori</i> information that
the sought distribution is smooth.&nbsp; Please note the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#The difference between smoothing and regularization">difference
between smoothing and regularization</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This prior knowledge of smoothness of the distribution can be well justified
for <a href="sedfit_help_ls-gs.htm"> g*(s) distributions</a> because of the broadening of the ‘true’
sedimentation coefficient distribution g(s) via diffusion.&nbsp; This diffusional
broadening can be imagined as a convolution of the true distribution by a
Gaussian.&nbsp; Therefore, we know that this apparent sedimentation coefficient
distribution must be smooth, because Gaussian-shaped for a single species, or a
superposition of Gaussians for several species.</p>

<p>Options | Size-Distribution Options | Regularization by Maximum Entropy</p>
</font></b>
<p>In brief, the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#Maximum entropy regularization"> maximum entropy principle</a> can be used for regularization of a
distribution analysis by executing a constrained fit:</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p><img SRC="images/Image5.gif" width="413" height="42"></p>
</font>
<p>The first term represents the unconstrained linear Lamm equation fit with a
distribution, e.g. <i>c(M)</i>, and the second term is the maximum entropy
constraint. The constraint is controlled by the parameter <font FACE="Symbol">a</font>,
which can be adjusted with the use of <a href="sedfit_help_calculator.htm#Calculate F-distribution">F-statistics</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The specific form of the maximum entropy functional is derived from the
statistical (Bayesian) consideration that in the absence of any prior knowledge
on the distribution <i>c(M)</i>, all the <i>M</i> values are <i>a priori</i>
equally probable. The form <i>clog(c)</i> can be shown by combinatorial methods
to be proportional to the number of microstates that can form the macroscopic
distribution <i>c(M)</i>. This can also be related to the informational entropy
introduced by Shannon. For a more complete description, see the <a href="sizedistributions.htm">introduction
to size-distributions</a>, or, e.g. Press et al.
Numerical Recipes in C.</p>
<p>The use of the maximum entropy functional as a constraint allows one to
calculate the distribution (e.g. <i><a href="sedfit_help_cm.htm">c(M)</a></i> 
or <a href="sedfit_help_cs.htm">c(s)</a>) that fits the data well (statistically
indistinguishable from the unconstrained case), but provides only the minimal
information required to fit the data.&nbsp; In other words, this allows us to
deviate only as little as possible from the underlying principle of not giving
any preference to any particular value of <i>M</i>, and in this way extract only
the essence of the data.</p>
<p>In practice such regularization is often used for suppressing noise
amplification in the inversion of Fredholm integral equations.</p>
<i><u><font COLOR="#008000">
<p>Please Note</font></u><font COLOR="#008000">: Maximum entropy helps suppress
artificial oscillation in the derived size-distributions. In my hands, it worked
better than the <a href="#Tikhonov-Phillips regularization using 2nd derivative"> Tikhonov-Phillips</a> second derivative regularization when using
the continuous Lamm equation model. However, for regularizing the least-squares
g*(s), the Tikhonov-Phillips seems to work better.</p>

function.&nbsp; The following just describes the input parameters:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/prior.jpg">'</p>
<p>The top left checkbox switches the use of prior expectation on or off.&nbsp; 
There are currently three types of prior implemented:</p>
<p>1) <b>From File: </b>This allows to use a two-column ASCII file specifying 
the probability distribution.&nbsp; The format is the same as the format 
generated when
<a href="sedfit_help_datautilities.htm#Save Calculated Distribution">saving 
sedimentation coefficient distributions</a>.&nbsp; The checkbox &quot;GJT&quot; file 
indicates a different format: that generated when
<a href="sedphat/isotherm_analysis.htm#saving GJT boundaries">saving 
Gilbert-Jenkins boundary shapes in SEDPHAT</a>. Regarding the terminology, it is 
recommended to address this c(s) as c<sup>(P</sup><sup>)</sup>(s).</p>
<p>2) <b>Select Peaks from Current Distribution:</b>&nbsp; This is the same as 
the keyboard shortcut control-X.&nbsp; This is an implementation of the idea 
that all species should be delta-peaks (e.g., for mixtures of pure proteins each 
with a single conformation and no microheterogeneity).&nbsp; From an existing 
c(s) distribution, the peaks are automatically detected.&nbsp; For each, a 
(numerical representation of a) delta-peak is placed at the weight-average 
s-value integrated across the peak.&nbsp; <b>Note - for this, a conventional c(s) 
analysis needs to be performed first before using this option.&nbsp; </b>It is 
suggested to refer to this c(s) version as c<sup>(P<font face="Symbol">d</font></sup><sup>)</sup>(s)</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; <b>From Gauss/Delta-Peaks:</b>&nbsp; This allows the user to 
manually specify several peaks to put emphasis at the indicated locations.&nbsp; 
When the width parameter is set zero, a delta-function is used.&nbsp; The 
amplitude is governing the area of the Gaussian.&nbsp; Typically useful values 
have been between 1 and 1000, but other positive values can be used, as well. 
(Amplitudes of zero switch the Prior off.)&nbsp; Note that the Gaussian is 
calculated <i>on the grid of s-values</i>, which can distort the Gaussian 
substantially if the width is on the same scale or smaller than the distance 
between neighboring s-values in the distribution.&nbsp; Again, for clarity it is 
recommended to refer to this c(s) as c<sup>(P)</sup>(s).</p>

<p>When using the prior for the c(s,ff0) distribution, after closing the input

f/f0- dimension.&nbsp; You'll be asked the same information about location, 
width, and amplitude of expected f/f0 values.&nbsp; When you're done enter a 
value of 0.&nbsp; If you don't want any prior in the f/f0 dimension, then say 
YES to the question &quot;do you want to use the prior&quot;, but then enter 0 for the 
first f/f0 value.</p>

<p>this is a shortcut for the execution of the above command switching on the 
Bayesian modeling with the option &quot;Select Peaks from Current Distribution&quot;, 
followed by a RUN command.&nbsp; This permits the simplified workflow:</p>
<p>1) calculate a normal c(s) distribution</p>
<p>2) use control-X to calculate the c(s) with the expectation that all peaks 
should be sharp.&nbsp; It should be useful, for example, for mixtures of pure 
proteins each with a single conformation and no microheterogeneity.</p>
<p>3) inspect the areas of the resulting peaks:&nbsp; a notepad file will pop up 
that shows how much material is <b>unaccounted</b> for by the discrete peaks.&nbsp;

<p>this can be an indication that the expectation of truly monodisperse material 
in each peak is not sufficient to explain the data: either previously unresolved 
smaller peaks exist (as shown by the distribution now obtained, with the amounts 
indicated), or the underlying assumption is not true. </p>
<p>Note that the Bayesian analysis can only give you different distributions 
that fit the data equally well.&nbsp; Which of the distributions is more likely 
the true one depends on the reliability of the prior that was supplied to the 
analysis.&nbsp; In any case, however, the Bayesian analysis lets us explore the 
range of possible distributions that fit the data equally well. </p>

<b><font COLOR="#0000ff">
<p>Options | Size-Distribution Options | transform g(s*) (as ASCII) to direct

</font></b>
<p>The current implementations of the dc/dt method to calculate g(s*) are
algorithms to transform and average experimental data into the space of apparent
sedimentation coefficients, producing the distribution g(s*).&nbsp; One drawback
of this approach is that there is no control how well the transformed data still
represent the experimental data.&nbsp; From <a href="lsgofs_distribution.htm">the
framework of the ls-g*(s) distribution</a>, however, it is quite straightforward
to build a boundary model from the g(s*) distribution by piecing together the
step-functions corresponding to each s* value.&nbsp; After the macromolecular
sedimentation boundaries corresponding to g(s*) have been reconstructed this
way, the time-invariant noise and/or radial-invariant noise components can be
calculated algebraically (restoring the degrees of freedom eliminated in the
time-derivative dc/dt).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, you can compare if the g(s*) distribution is a realistic
representation of the data or not.&nbsp; You will get an rms error of the g(s*)
model, which may be used, for example, as a direct and rational criterion if too
many scans were used in dcdt or not.</p>
<p>This approach and the results are described in detail in <b><font size="3"> <u><a href="images/ProteinSelfAssociation_AnalBiochem.pdf">Analytical
Biochemistry </a></u><a href="images/ProteinSelfAssociation_AnalBiochem.pdf">320:104-124</a></font></b>.</p>
<p>Instructions for use of this model are simple (a reminder will be given when
using it): After calculating g(s*) by dcdt (for example using DCDT+), write the
distribution data to an ASCII file with error estimates, and then select this
file in sedfit.&nbsp; Note that you should not correct the s-values to s20,w -
you need to use uncorrected s-values.</p>

<p>Options | Size-Distribution Options | suppress baseline correlation in Max 
Ent</p>
</b>
</font>
<p>When using the standard maximum entropy regularization for data that do not 
allow to distinguish well the baseline from the signal in the smallest s-value 
of the distribution, it used to be that the resulting baseline correlation can 
create a large increasing signal in the distribution.&nbsp; When the present 
option is toggled on, this correlation is suppressed by using the Bayesian 
expectation that the signal at s-min should vanish if possible.&nbsp; If the 
resulting distribution still shows a half-peak at the lowest s-value it means 
that there really is sedimenting material present, and one may want to lower the 
s-min value to get a better description of that material.</p>
