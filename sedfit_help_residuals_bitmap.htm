<p><b><u>The concept:</u></b></p>
<p>In order to gain a more detailed representation of the residuals, the
residuals can be displayed as a (RGB) picture.</p>
<p> Each
horizontal line of screen pixels corresponds to one scan (ordered according to
time), and each pixel within that line corresponds to a radial position. The
values of the residuals between data and fit are transformed into a color or
grayscale.&nbsp; For perfect residuals, this will result in a picture that is
completely uniform, while any residuals will appear as structures in the
picture.&nbsp; This makes use of the exquisite sensitivity human eye for
recognizing structures and patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, three different kinds of patterns can be distinguished:&nbsp;
1)&nbsp; diagonal stripes, which are indicative of imperfect fitting of the
sedimentation process;&nbsp; 2) vertical stripes, caused by (almost)
time-invariant features and imperfections in the data acquisition; 3) horizontal
lines, cause by bad scans (outlier scans, which sometimes occur particularly
with the interference optics with 'rocking' instabilities).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When judging fits, it should be kept in mind that the criterion of a
completely unstructured bitmap may not be possible to achieve. For example, the
following fit of the sedimentation of an IgG sample (95% monomer and 5% dimer,
using a two-component Lamm equation model) has an rms error of &lt; 0.0028
fringes, which is probably as good as the commercial interference optics
configuration is able to produce.&nbsp; Nevertheless there is all three typical
systematics visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit22.gif" width="800" height="59"></p>
<p>(max scale 0.02 for bitmap).&nbsp; Importantly, however, the diagonal pattern
is relatively faint, and the instrumental systematic noise patterns appear at
least equally strong.&nbsp; This is the corresponding residuals overlay, from
which much less information can be extracted:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit23.gif" width="708" height="187"></p>
<p>If the same data are analyzed leaving out the 5% dimer, a fit with 0.0038 rms
fringes is achieved, which is still very good, and the residuals overlay looks
OK:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sedfit24.gif" width="708" height="184"></p>
<p>However, the residuals bitmap now shows a clear diagonal pattern that
dominates the picture.&nbsp; This is indicative of insufficient boundary
modeling, showing that there is more information in the sedimentation boundary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, for example, a single disctinct <i>horizontal </i>line is observed in the 
bitmap, this may be the result of a single bad scan.&nbsp; This can be excluded 
using the utility function
<a href="sedfit_help_loading_options.htm#exclude worst scan">'exclude worst 
scan'</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b>Some technical details:</b></u></p>
<p>How the bitmap actually looks will also depend on
the color settings of your display, therefore there are two switches:
black/white <i>vs.</i> color, and continuous shading (brightness of pixel
corresponds to magnitude of residual) vs. discrete shading (only sign of the
residual is regarded and translated into a brightness, analogous to a runs
test).&nbsp; In my experience, the best results are obtained with a continuous
shading in black and white.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Also, it should be noted that because the bitmap is
scaled in absolute pixels, the bitmap may not be visible entirely if the S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> 
window is too small, or if a display with too low resolution is used.</b></font></p>
<p dynamicanimation="fpAnimformatRolloverFP1" fprolloverstyle="border-style: dotted; border-color: #FF0000" onmouseover="rollIn(this)" onmouseout="rollOut(this)" language="Javascript1.2">!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="1">in order to see continuous shading of the RGB bitmap, it may be
necessary to set the display to a higher color resolution.&nbsp; However, if S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> 
is run on the data acquisition computer for the XLI (as supplied by Beckman), a
higher color resolution may not be compatible with the video board used for data
acquisition.&nbsp; In this case, it may be necessary to perform the data
analysis on a separate PC.</font></p>
<p>When toggling the bitmap on, the user can enter the magnitude of the
residuals corresponding to the full scale color.&nbsp; The default value is
0.05, meaning that all residuals &lt; - 0.05 are completely black, and all
residuals &gt; 0.05 are completely white.&nbsp; A value of 0 will scale
according to the largest residual in the fit (this may not be the best scale for
visualizing low-level systematic deviations, therefore the default is
0.05).&nbsp; For changing this scale, the bitmap has to be toggled off
first.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For documentation, the residuals bitmap can be <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Residuals Bitmap">copied
as an RGB picture</a> to the clipboard, from which it can be pasted into a
variety of different programs.</p>
