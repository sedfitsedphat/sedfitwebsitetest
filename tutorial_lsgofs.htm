<p><u><b><a name="The use of the apparent sedimentation coefficient distribution ls-g*(s)">The
use of the apparent sedimentation coefficient distribution ls-g*(s)</a></b></u> </p>
<p>For preparation of this topic, please read the <a href="tutorial_lsgofs.htm">
tutorial on ls-g*(s)</a>.</p>
<p>Although the c(s) distribution has big advantages in resolution over the
apparent sedimentation coefficient distribution g*(s), there are situations
where the deconvolution of diffusion is not desired or necessary (e.g. when
working with very large particles where diffusion is negligible, or just as
comparison to the results of the dcdt analysis).&nbsp; <b>It should be noted
that because ls-g*(s) is a direct boundary model, we do not need to constrain the
data set as much as in the dcdt transformation</b>.&nbsp; There is no broadening from too many scans.&nbsp;
Details are described in this <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10935973&amp;dopt=Abstract">reference</a>.&nbsp;
<b>However, the number of scans included should not be so large as to lead to a 
bad fit.</b>&nbsp;
</p>
<p><font size="1">(Please note that ls-g*(s) should not be applied to small sets
of interference scans where the boundary has not yet cleared the meniscus,
because of correlations of the small s-values with the unknown time-invariant
baseline.)&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> 
 has implemented the g*(s) in the form of a <a href="sedfit_help_ls-gs.htm">least-squares
direct boundary model ls-g*(s)</a>.&nbsp; This is described in the <a href="lsgofs_distribution.htm">introduction
to ls-g*(s)</a>, serves as an example in the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#An example from the calculation of apparent sedimentation coefficient distributions ls-g*(s)">introduction
to size-distributions</a>, and in the <a href="sedfit_help_ls-gs.htm">help-page
for ls-g*(s)</a>.&nbsp; Here, we only describe its practical application to the
BSA data set. Another application can be seen in the <a href="sedfit_example.htm">example
of using S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span></a>. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>NEW:&nbsp; Please note the new <a href="sedfit_help_size_distribution_options.htm#Integrate Distribution">integration
tool</a>, which allows calculating the weight-average s-value of the sedimenting

<p>The application of the ls-g*(s) analysis has many similarities to the c(s)
analysis, but it is much simpler because of the absence of deconvolution of
diffusion  and as a result it gives only much lower resolution.</p>

<p>An information box will
appear as a reminder that with ls-g*(s) the regularization method will be
changed:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori47.gif" width="325" height="99"></p>
<p>the relevance of this is described in detail in the <a href="sizedistributions.htm#Tikhonov-Phillips versus maximum entropy regularization, and the use of Monte-Carlo statistics">introduction
to the size-distribution</a> -- we can accept this default setting.&nbsp;
Dependent on the previous parameter settings, a second message may appear</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori48.gif" width="194" height="98"></p>
<p>with the reminder that taking into account the acceleration phase of the
rotor is not required in the g*(s) model.</p>
<p>We have to press the <a href="sedfit_help_parameters.htm">parameter</a> menu
to get to the settings:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori49.gif" width="332" height="303"></p>
<p>The meaning of the parameters is the same as with the c(s) distribution
above, except that there are much fewer parameters.&nbsp; Basically, we need to
adjust s-min and s-max to give the proper s-range (we know already that a
reasonable range would be 1 to 12).&nbsp; The resolution does not need to be
nearly as high as in the c(s) analysis, because we will not need to describe any
sharp peaks.</p>
<p>Simply executing a <a href="sedfit_help_run.htm">Run</a> command will give us
the ls-g*(s) distribution:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori8.jpg" width="665" height="566"></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the quality of the fit is in general very poor, as the
apparent sedimentation coefficient distributions do not describe
diffusion.&nbsp; Therefore, unless we are dealing with very large particles or 
very high rotor speeds where diffusion is negligible, we have to reduce the 
number of scans in the fit to get a reliable analysis.</p>
<p>For example, considering only scans 90 to 129, we get a more reasonable fit 
if we use a high value for the 'resolution' field.&nbsp; (The latter decreases 
the size of the step-function, and allows to differentiate the misfit due to 
finite discretization from misfit due to significant diffusion).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If applied to the same data subset, the result of ls-g*(s) and dcdt will be
the same, with the exception if a very large data set with large <font face="Symbol">D</font>t
is used, or for very small sedimentation coefficients, where the direct boundary
model ls-g*(s) is more advantageous. As described in the <a href="sizedistributions.htm">introduction
to the size-distribution theory</a>, due to the use of regularization there is
very little noise apparent in the distribution (without <a href="sizedistributions.htm#The difference between smoothing and regularization">smoothing</a>).&nbsp; </p>
<p>In some cases, it may be desirable to optimize in a non-linear regression the
position of the meniscus.&nbsp; One such case is when working with very large
macromolecules at low rotor speed, where the deformations of the meniscus can
make a graphical determination very difficult.</p>
