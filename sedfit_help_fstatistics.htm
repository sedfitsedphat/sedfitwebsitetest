<p>For analyzing the quality of fits obtained with different parameter values,
the variance of the fit (chi-square) is a very useful statistical quantity. The
ratio of the chi-square of two fits is distributed like a Fisher (F)
distribution. Therefore, this distribution can be used to judge if a given
variance increase (e.g. after change of a parameter value) has a magnitude in a
range that could occur just by statistical error in the data (assuming normally
distributed noise), or if the variance increase is significant.</p>
<p> S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>  has a <a href="sedfit_help_calculator.htm#Calculate F-distribution">F-statistics
calculator</a> in the Options menu.&nbsp; The calculator is used in the <a href="sedfit_example.htm">example
for using S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span></a> for testing
the significance of a contaminating species, and the confidence limit of an
s-value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The principle mostly adopted when using the F-statistics for parameter error analysis is to
constrain one parameter (the one for which the error estimates are being
calculated) while optimizing (floating) all others to achieve the best-fit given
this one constraint.&nbsp; Obviously, because of the constraint in the first
parameter, the chi-square of the distribution increases.&nbsp; F-statistics can predict the increase of the sum of squares that
is associated e.g. with one standard deviation contour of the parameters.&nbsp;
This will depend also on the number of data points and the overall best-fit sum
of squares.&nbsp; This procedure, as described in <i>Bevington: Data Reduction
in the Physical Sciences</i> and in <i>Press et al.: Numerical Recipes in C</i>,
incorporates correlation of the fit parameters into the error estimates, and
does not make assumptions about the shape of error contour map. The F-statistics
is implemented as described in Johnson &amp; Straume (<a href="#ref1">ref1</a>).</p>
<p>A second usage for the F-statistics is to decide if the signal contribution
from a species is significant or not.</p>

<p>The display after simulation and during the fitting procedure contains the
runs-test. It gives a measure, Z, for how random the residuals are, based on the
sequence of the sign (positive or negative) of the residuals. The Z-value gives
the number of standard deviations by which the given number of runs is
statistically different from the expectation value for normally distributed
noise. For Z-values smaller than 2-4, the residuals are pretty random, for very
large Z-values the residuals are non-random, and have systematics (runs or
positive or negative residuals).</p>
<p>This feature is useful to assess the statistical quality of the fit, in
particular, when the large number of scans does obscure their inspection for
randomness.</p>
<p>This test is implemented as described in ML Johnson, Methods Enzymol 1992,
(Numerical Methods volume 210) p 96.</p>
