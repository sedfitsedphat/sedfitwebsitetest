<p>After calculating c(s), we can use the function
<a href="sedfit_help_display.htm#Show Peak Mw in c(s)">&quot;Show Peak Mw in c(s)&quot;</a> 
to automatically print out molar mass estimates for each peak. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori62.gif"></p>
<p>This is information is similar to the transformation of c(s) to c(M) 
described in the following.&nbsp; Accordingly, the molar mass estimate &quot;Mf&quot; is 
based on the best-fit frictional ratio (or other relationships for s and D if a 
specialized variant of c(s) is used).&nbsp; The value in parenthesis is the 
minimum molar mass of a spherical particle of given density.</p>
<p>As described above, these are clickable boxes that produce more information 
on each peak and how it relates to the raw data.</p>

of c(s) to a molar mass distribution c(M)</a></b></u> </p>
<p>After calculating the c(s) distribution and optimizing the parameters for the
frictional ratio and meniscus, we can transform the c(s) distribution into a <a href="sedfit_help_cm.htm">c(M)
distribution</a>.&nbsp; This can be done because in the calculation of c(s), for
each s-value a diffusion coefficient D(s) was estimated (with the s-D
relationship based on the optimal weight-average frictional ratio).&nbsp; Since s and
D directly determines M, we also have M for each species, and in this way we can
directly convert
c(s) into c(M).&nbsp; </p>

<p>This leads to </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori47.jpg"></p>
<p>which we need to rescale by drawing a rectangle with the right mouse button 
so as to show us the peaks:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori63.gif"></p>
<p>resulting in </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori48.jpg"></p>
<p>If we export the distribution again
(using the <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm#Copy Data Tables">copy command</a>)
into Origin, we can generate the following graph, which shows the oligomers of
BSA with reasonable estimates of the molar mass:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/tutori45.gif" width="423" height="317"></p>
<p>This may in general not work as well if the frictional ratio of the monomer differs much from the frictional ratios of the oligomers.&nbsp;
In this case, the c(M) distribution will appear distorted. </p>
<p><i><font color="#008000" size="2">New in version 8.7:&nbsp; It is sometimes possible, in particular if there is a
substantial amount of oligomeric material with well-separated s-values, to use
the model of a <a href="sedfit_help_cs_with_other_prior.htm#c(s) with bimodal ff0">bi-modal
c(s) distribution</a> and to optimize two separate f/f0 values.&nbsp; For
example, one could be the monomer, one for the higher oligomers.&nbsp; This is
also useful if there are two different macromolecular compounds with widely
differing s-ranges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></i> </p>
<p>The best way to treat oligomerizing system is the
<a href="sedphat/hybrid_local_continuos_global_discrete.htm">SEDPHAT model for 
hybrid discrete/continuous distributions</a>, in which the molar mass ratio of 
the oligomers can be constraint to be multiples.&nbsp; To get started with this, 
use the <font color="#FF0000"> <a href="export_to_sedphat.htm">Export 
function of SEDFIT to transfer your data into SEDPHAT</a></font>.</p>
