<p>Fitted distributions, residuals and fitting parameters can be stored on the
hard disk.</p>
<p>For some models (c(s), c(s,f), and c(s) or c(s,f) with discrete component) 
this automatically writes the ~tmppars.* file to the directory where the data 
are located, such that the current fit can be
<a href="sedfit_help_LoadNewData.htm#restore the previous analysis">restored</a> 
when loading the data.</p>
<p>First, the calculated best-fit radial distributions can be saved in files
with filenames that can be specified in the ‘<i>save fitted data as</i>’
dialog box. The filenames of the fitted curves proposed depend on the <a href="sedfit_help_loading_options.htm#Filename Conventions"> filename
convention</a> that was specified (newer Windows Beckman software assumed as default).  For
the newer convention (Windows XLA software), the first character of the original data filename
will be replaced with a
‘f’ - for ‘fitted’ and the rest of the name will be kept the same. This way,
for each data file (e.g., 00006.ra2) a new file (f0006.ra2) is created.&nbsp; For the older convention (old
DOS software for 4-hole rotors), where the file extension identifies the
scan sequence, the extensions are kept for the saved distributions, but filename
can be changed (e.g., ‘fitcell1.r01’). <font color="#FF00FF">Please note
that it is currently not possible to deviate from this rule.&nbsp; Therefore, a
new directory should be chosen to save multiple alternative fits!</font></p>
<p>The saved data will contain the calculated best-fit distributions as shown
between the green lines in the upper plot in S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span>.&nbsp; The files will be in
XLA format and compatible to re-analysis with S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">edfit</span> or other software.
Analogously, the residuals will be saved with a 'r' as first character in the
filenames, and be saved in XLA format.&nbsp; For the parameters, a file like ‘fitparams.ra2’ will be
generated. Information saved in this file will include,

<p>Data | Save Systematic Noise | Subtract Noise from Eq. Data</p>
</font></b>
<p>If the data analysis has been performed with the time-independent noise
option, the calculated systematic TI noise can be subtracted from an equilibrium
scan.</p>
<p>The strategy would be the following: First, load as set of scans from the approach to
equilibrium (should cover a substantial part of the visible sedimentation
process), and analyze them allowing for TI noise.&nbsp; The model used is
secondary, but it is of highest importance that an excellent fit is achieved
without any systematic residuals.&nbsp; Second, use this menu to load a scan
from sedimentation equilibrium and subtract the previously calculated TI noise. Save the new
file with a new name (suggested extension: is &quot;*.RTI&quot;). This new file
contains equilibrium data corrected for the systematic noise contribution, as identified by
the sequence of approach to equilibrium scans. This should improve the quality
of the equilibrium profile and of their analysis. In particular, this can
eliminate or reduce the errors in the equilibrium scans resulting from
imperfections in the window. The radial grid points of the equilibrium data are
not changed for the subtraction. The method seems to work best for low loading
concentrations.&nbsp; It has bee described in detail in&nbsp;</p>
<p> P. Schuck (1999) Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of interference optical
data by systematic noise decomposition. <i><u><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10415089&amp;dopt=Abstract">Analytical Biochemistry</a></u></i>

272:199-208</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experimental procedure for eliminating the time-invariant noise
contribution from equilibrium scans is the use of external loading cells and the
acquisition of before and after-blanks. This is described in detail in&nbsp;</p>
<p> Ansevin
et al., Anal Biochem 1970, 237-261.</p>

<font size="1">Great care should be taken that the TI
noise component does not contain systematic patterns, resulting from a the use
of an insufficient model in the approach to equilibrium analysis.&nbsp; The quality of fit of the approach to equilibrium data should be
optimal, and the use of a very large model is recommended, which not necessarily
has to reflect properties of the true solutes.&nbsp; After all, the modeling of the
approach to equilibrium could be considered here an informed smoothing operation
employing all possible solutions of the Lamm equation, without any further
interpretation beyond the extraction of TI noise. For example, with absorbance
data, fitting with a <a href="sedfit_help_sedimentation_time_offset.htm">floating
starting time</a> was occasionally found to be very useful.&nbsp; If the TI noise contains any systematic drift, this
can introduce systematic bias into the new equilibrium data.&nbsp; If the TI noise does
not contain a systematic pattern or drift, but looks randomly distributed, it
should provide a good correction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

For publication quality graphics, it is recommended to use the <a href="sedfit_help_copy.htm">copy
